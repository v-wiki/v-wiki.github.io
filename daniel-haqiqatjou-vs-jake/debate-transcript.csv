"30480","39500"," Today we will be continuing the debates from earlier with Brother Jake Brancatella and Daniel Haqqa Ghajju.","Host"
"40060","44420"," This debate will consist of two sections.","Host"
"44980","51360"," First, covering the topic of the Ash'ari and Maturidi creeds, whether or not they are deviant.","Host"
"51360","60360"," And secondly, who is the true or real Athari, Ibn Taymiyyah or Daniel Haqqa Ghajju.","Host"
"61080","66980"," So, inshallah, these will be fruitful and informative, enlightening discussions.","Host"
"67920","72240"," And whoever would like to go first, we can start the 15-minute opening segment.","Host"
"72800","74380"," Alright, over to you, brother.","Host"
"75160","79180"," In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.","Jake Brancatella"
"79320","80760"," Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.","Jake Brancatella"
"81400","83160"," And peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of God.","Jake Brancatella"
"83760","85100"," And after that, peace and blessings be upon you.","Jake Brancatella"
"87560","93640"," Okay, so this is the start of the second overall debate with two sections.","Jake Brancatella"
"93940","99680"," This one is going to be on the Ash'ari and Maturidi creeds and answering whether or not they're deviant.","Jake Brancatella"
"99680","104740"," I'm saying definitively that they are, and I'm assuming that Daniel will be defending that they're not.","Jake Brancatella"
"105680","108460"," And I'll explain why this is important as we go along.","Jake Brancatella"
"108900","114060"," So the first quote that I want to take a look at is from Fakhr al-Din al-Razi.","Jake Brancatella"
"114460","123400"," And I'm going to be going through examples of the Ash'aris explaining their own beliefs for themselves and contrast it with the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah.","Jake Brancatella"
"124020","139580"," So he says, regarding knowledge and how we should interpret scripture, he says, know that if definitive rational proofs establish something, and we then find scriptural evidence that appears to contradict it, the situation can only be one of four possibilities.","Jake Brancatella"
"140140","147280"," Either both rational and scriptural evidence is accepted, which entails believing in two contradictories, and this is impossible.","Jake Brancatella"
"147900","154200"," Or both are rejected, which also entails rejecting two contradictories, and this is impossible.","Jake Brancatella"
"154200","176760"," Or the apparent meanings of the scriptural texts are accepted, and the rational proofs are rejected, which is invalid because we can only know the validity of the scriptural texts through rational proofs that establish the existence of the Creator, His attributes, and the veracity of the miracles that prove the truthfulness of the Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu wa salam.","Jake Brancatella"
"180150","185730"," So basically Arazi there is saying that reason is over-revelation,","Jake Brancatella"
"185910","190650"," that if reason, and we'll see his fake aqli, or fake rational principles","Jake Brancatella"
"190650","192970"," that they believe in, the Ash'aris and Maturidis,","Jake Brancatella"
"193450","197950"," that they use to then justify their ta'wilat,","Jake Brancatella"
"198010","202590"," or making ridiculous interpretations that are not consistent with the text,","Jake Brancatella"
"202650","207170"," they have to do that because the so-called rational proofs that they rely on","Jake Brancatella"
"207170","209110"," are more important than scripture.","Jake Brancatella"
"209690","225090"," Attaf Tizani says, It is obligatory that these texts are speculative and transmitted, contrary to definitive rational proofs, meaning the Qur'an is actually a speculative text.","Jake Brancatella"
"225910","230750"," Therefore, it is certain that they are not to be taken on their apparent meaning.","Jake Brancatella"
"231330","237650"," Their meanings should either be consigned to Allah, or interpreted in a way that aligns with rational evidence.","Jake Brancatella"
"238270","255510"," If it is argued that if the true religion denies spatial existence and direction, then why do the scriptures and prophetic traditions imply the existence of such attributes in numerous places without explicitly denying or explaining their impossibility?","Jake Brancatella"
"255589","270410"," In other words, if Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala doesn't have a direction of aboveness or any type of spatial existence in that way, then why do the scriptures of the Qur'an and Sunnah seem to imply this, and why is it never explicitly denied?","Jake Brancatella"
"270830","288130"," He responds, This should be explicitly denied, especially as the scriptures repeatedly affirm the existence of the Creator, His oneness, His knowledge, His power, and the reality of the resurrection, and the gathering of bodies in several places with utmost emphasis.","Jake Brancatella"
"288130","305030"," This issue also deserves utmost emphasis and clarification because rational people's innate nature, regardless of their religions and views, inclines toward looking upwards when praying and raising their hands toward the sky.","Jake Brancatella"
"305470","308150"," The response is that since the denial of direction","Jake Brancatella"
"308150","310970"," is beyond the comprehension of the general public,","Jake Brancatella"
"311350","314730"," who almost certainly reject what is not within a direction,","Jake Brancatella"
"314730","317970"," it was more appropriate in their addresses,","Jake Brancatella"
"318610","320990"," and more conducive to their well-being,","Jake Brancatella"
"321210","323890"," and more suitable for inviting them to the truth,","Jake Brancatella"
"324310","328730"," to use expressions that appear to imply anthropomorphism,","Jake Brancatella"
"329710","333190"," meaning that the dhahr of the text of the Qur'an and Sunnah","Jake Brancatella"
"333190","338870"," is actually tashbih and tajseem, according to Ahtaf Tazani.","Jake Brancatella"
"338990","340990"," This is not your neighbor from down the street.","Jake Brancatella"
"341290","348890"," And he says the reason why this was done is because the general public are too stupid to comprehend and get it.","Jake Brancatella"
"349150","353870"," They do not believe in anything that is not in a jihah, or in a direction.","Jake Brancatella"
"356030","359810"," Okay, what about the mutakallim's first obligation?","Jake Brancatella"
"360670","376530"," The first obligation upon a rational adult, this is from al-Ju'ayni, upon reaching the age of maturity or puberty, according to the sharia, is to engage in correct contemplation that leads to knowledge of the world's origination.","Jake Brancatella"
"377530","387270"," And if you don't do that, many of the so-called mutakallimim of the Ash'aris and Maturidis actually explicitly say that your faith is not valid.","Jake Brancatella"
"388330","392190"," An-Nawawi, who Daniel loves to quote, responds to this and says,","Jake Brancatella"
"392530","394870"," the prophet's saying in another narration,","Jake Brancatella"
"395370","397370"," I have been commanded to fight the people","Jake Brancatella"
"397370","400130"," until they testify that there is no god but Allah","Jake Brancatella"
"400130","402490"," and they believe in me and what I have brought,","Jake Brancatella"
"402830","407730"," provides clear evidence supporting the view of the majority of the Salaf","Jake Brancatella"
"407730","412030"," and later scholars that if a person firmly believes in Islam","Jake Brancatella"
"412030","414370"," without any doubt, that is sufficient.","Jake Brancatella"
"414690","417190"," And he is considered a believer among the monotheists.","Jake Brancatella"
"417550","423470"," He is not obliged to learn the mutakallimim's proofs and to know Allah through them.","Jake Brancatella"
"423470","436570"," This contradicts those who insist, as we just saw from al-Juwaini, that it is obligatory and a condition for being considered among the people of the Qibla, claiming that one cannot be deemed a Muslim without it.","Jake Brancatella"
"437010","444330"," This view is held by many Martezalites and some of our mutakallimim, but it is evidently incorrect.","Jake Brancatella"
"444730","451610"," Now just because An-Nawawi disagrees with it, doesn't mean that this is not a foundational position of the Ash'aris and Maturidis.","Jake Brancatella"
"451610","459830"," It is, and that would deem the majority of the ummah to not actually be upon Islam and be true believers.","Jake Brancatella"
"460190","463430"," So in actual fact, it is the Ash'aris and Maturidis","Jake Brancatella"
"463430","467190"," based upon their own principles who are the biggest tech theories","Jake Brancatella"
"467190","471030"," because the common person, the common Muslim,","Jake Brancatella"
"471290","477210"," who is a farmer in Afghanistan or Indonesia or some other place,","Jake Brancatella"
"477210","481230"," these people are not going through the complicated proofs,","Jake Brancatella"
"482090","484510"," so-called rational proofs of the mutakallimim,","Jake Brancatella"
"484670","487170"," and if they don't do that, they're still Muslims,","Jake Brancatella"
"487410","489910"," as opposed to what the Ash'aris and Maturidis say.","Jake Brancatella"
"492170","506910"," Saifuddin al-Ahmadi says, in describing what iman is, he says, thus the invalidity of the Hashawiya's assertion is established that iman is belief in the heart, verbal affirmation, and action with the limbs.","Jake Brancatella"
"507390","526530"," He attributes this view to a group called the Hashawiya, which is actually an insult, but we are going to see who the people are who believe that iman is belief in the heart, verbal affirmation, and action with limbs, rather than just merely tasdiq, or the affirmation of the heart.","Jake Brancatella"
"527170","539530"," Al-Juwaini says, section on the meaning of iman, know that our purpose in this section requires us first to mention the essence of iman, which is a matter of differing opinions among Islamic schools.","Jake Brancatella"
"539990","551350"," The Khawarij believed that iman is obedience, and many of the Muqtazilites leaned towards this view, though they differed on whether supererogatory acts could be considered part of iman.","Jake Brancatella"
"551670","562350"," The Hadith scholars, meaning Ahl al-Hadith, pay attention Dan, maintained that iman is knowledge in the heart, acknowledgment by the tongue, and action by the limbs.","Jake Brancatella"
"563010","572710"," Well, Juwaini says that the position of the scholars of Hadith is exactly what al-Amidi calls the position of the Hashawiya.","Jake Brancatella"
"574880","582900"," Okay, he continues and says, some early scholars held that iman is simply the heart's recognition and acknowledgment of it.","Jake Brancatella"
"583240","595680"," Our accepted view, this is the teacher of al-Ghazali, our accepted view, meaning the Ash'ari view, is that the essence of iman is the affirmation of Allah, and thus the believer in Allah is the one who affirms it.","Jake Brancatella"
"595740","599560"," So it's completely opposed to the Salaf and the position of Ahl al-Hadith.","Jake Brancatella"
"600540","614760"," Imam Ibn Abdulbar says, the scholars of jurisprudence, the scholars of fiqh and Hadith, unanimously agreed that iman is speech and action, and that there is no action without intention.","Jake Brancatella"
"614760","621760"," According to them, iman increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience.","Jake Brancatella"
"623460","634820"," Al-Kawthari says, and this is him actually mocking Imam al-Bukhari, this is what the Ash'ari and Maturidi scholars are known for, they actually mock the scholars of Hadith.","Jake Brancatella"
"635220","652420"," He says, these righteous ones, the Salaf, by holding that belief necessarily aligns with the Mu'tazilites, or the Khawarij, if they consider deviation from their belief to be innovation and misguidance, this is because neglecting any action which is a pillar of iman constitutes a deficiency in iman.","Jake Brancatella"
"652720","665700"," So whoever neglects an action falls out of iman, either entering into disbelief, as the Khawarij say, or not entering into it, but being in a position between disbelief and iman, as is the view of the Mu'tazilites.","Jake Brancatella"
"665820","671100"," They, the Salaf, are among the people who most strongly disassociate from these two groups.","Jake Brancatella"
"671440","681560"," If they also disassociate from what Abu Hanifa and his companions and the other imams of this matter adhere to, their stance remains incoherent and incomprehensible.","Jake Brancatella"
"681900","691120"," He continues, however, if they considered actions only as part of the perfection of iman, there would be no reason for such contention and mutual renunciation.","Jake Brancatella"
"691600","703320"," But their extreme rigidity indicates that they consider actions not just part of the perfection of iman, but an essential pillar of it, leading to the consequences you see.","Jake Brancatella"
"703960","724300"," Strangely, listen to this, strangely, some consider one of their leaders in hadith to be saying proudly, quote, I did not include in my book anyone who does not consider iman to be composed of speech and action, which increases and decreases, despite including extremists among the Khawarij and others.","Jake Brancatella"
"724520","727880"," This is directly referring to Imam al-Bukhari.","Jake Brancatella"
"727880","737680"," He is mocking Imam al-Bukhari for saying that I did not include anyone within my book who did not accept the correct understanding and definition of iman.","Jake Brancatella"
"739440","755400"," Okay, Imam al-Bukhari says here, and it's quoted by Ibn Hajar, I met more than a thousand scholars across various regions, and I did not see anyone differing on the fact that iman consists of speech and action and that it increases and decreases.","Jake Brancatella"
"755640","756760"," So this is the context.","Jake Brancatella"
"756760","766440"," Now, another one of Dan's favorite scholars, As-Subqi, says this, they are a group who strayed from the right path, and their vision is blinded.","Jake Brancatella"
"766780","773180"," They interpret the verses of the attributes according to their apparent meaning and believe that this is what is intended.","Jake Brancatella"
"773540","785480"," He's referring to the Hashawiya, who he claims are those who interpret the Quran and Sunnah based upon their apparent meanings, which is what Ahl al-Hadith and the Hanabilah, the Atharis, do.","Jake Brancatella"
"786400","801120"," Imam Ibn Abd al-Bahr says on Allah's attributes, they, or the Ahl al-Sunnah, are unanimous in affirming that all the attributes mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah, believing in them and understanding them literally, not metaphorically.","Jake Brancatella"
"801460","807800"," However, they do not assign any specific modality to these attributes or limit them to a specific description.","Jake Brancatella"
"808140","818460"," As for the people of innovation, the Jahmiya, the Mu'tazila, in all their forms, and the Khawarij, they all deny these attributes and do not accept any of them literally.","Jake Brancatella"
"818820","834100"," So you have on the one hand, Imam Ibn Abd al-Bahr, saying it's the consensus of the Ummah, we're sorry, the consensus of the Ahl al-Sunnah, to believe in the Quran and Sunnah based upon their apparent meaning, and As-Subqi says that this is the position of the Hashawiya.","Jake Brancatella"
"835080","847740"," Okay, Mullah Ali al-Qari says, In summary, both the Salaf and the Khalaf make ta'weel, as they unanimously agree to move away from the apparent meaning of the text.","Jake Brancatella"
"848040","852640"," However, the interpretation of the Salaf is general, as they consign the true meaning to Allah.","Jake Brancatella"
"853020","860260"," In contrast, the interpretation of the Khalaf is detailed due to the necessity brought about by the proliferation of innovators.","Jake Brancatella"
"861130","869820"," Al-Bajuri says, By tafweed, what is meant is to divert the wording from its apparent meaning, without attempting to specify the intended meaning.","Jake Brancatella"
"870280","887940"," Imam As-Subqi, Dan's favorite scholar, said, The Salaf and the Khalaf have unanimously agreed to make ta'weel of the ambiguous verses in a general sense, by diverting the wording from its apparent meaning, which is impossible for Allah, due to the conclusive evidence that He is unlike created beings.","Jake Brancatella"
"887940","906860"," So on the one hand, the Ash'aris in Mataridi say, No, the actual ijma' of the ummah is that we have to negate the apparent meaning of these texts, and people like Imam Ibn Abd al-Bar are saying the exact opposite, that this is the unanimous position of what the Salaf affirmed.","Jake Brancatella"
"907520","910640"," What about the Ash'ari position on Allah's actions?","Jake Brancatella"
"911080","932600"," Ibn Taymiyyah says, and describes it as, and I quote, According to him, al-Ash'ari, and those who deny that volitional actions can be attributed to Allah's essence, the meaning is that he creates certain states of phenomena in some of his creations, and calls them dissent, just as he said that he creates in the throne a meaning which he calls istiwa.","Jake Brancatella"
"932900","938960"," For the Ash'ari, this means drawing the throne closer to himself without any action occurring within him.","Jake Brancatella"
"939340","956180"," He considered Allah's inherent actions, like dissent and istiwa, to be like his transitive actions, such as creation, beneficence, all of which, according to him, are effects that are separate from him, meaning that Allah doesn't have any actions within his essence.","Jake Brancatella"
"956640","962880"," All of his quote-unquote actions of judging, creating, and so on, are actually things that are makhluq and within creation.","Jake Brancatella"
"964960","973480"," Imam al-Bukhari on Allah's actions says, The jahmiyyah said that creation is the same thing as the created thing.","Jake Brancatella"
"973840","977520"," But the scholars said that creating is an action of Allah.","Jake Brancatella"
"977920","983820"," So the view that Imam al-Bukhari ascribes to the jahmiyyah is actually the view of the Ash'aris.","Jake Brancatella"
"985040","1003480"," Al-Jurjani on the Qur'an being created said, Know that what the ma'tazala say about the speech of Allah, namely, that it consists of created sounds and letters indicating intended meanings and that these are occurrences existing apart from the essence, is something we agree with.","Jake Brancatella"
"1003740","1008340"," There is no dispute between us, meaning the Ash'aris, and them on this matter.","Jake Brancatella"
"1008600","1015420"," However, what we assert and affirm as internal speech, which is distinct from other attributes, is something they deny.","Jake Brancatella"
"1015820","1021060"," Even if they were to acknowledge it, they would not deny its eternal nature, which we claim for his speech.","Jake Brancatella"
"1021060","1027740"," Thus, the point of contention between us and them lies in the denial or affirmation of this internal meaning.","Jake Brancatella"
"1028099","1034920"," Meaning, basically, the Ash'aris and Ma'taridis also believe that the Arabic Qur'an is makhluq.","Jake Brancatella"
"1035140","1035920"," How much time do I have left?","Jake Brancatella"
"1041910","1042450"," Oh, okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"1042530","1045510"," Let me just finish this slide then.","Jake Brancatella"
"1046670","1048310"," I just want to hear a quote here.","Jake Brancatella"
"1048430","1050650"," Al-Ghazali criticizing Imam Ahmed.","Jake Brancatella"
"1051030","1061450"," He says that Ahmed ibn Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, only interpreted three hadiths because the impossibility of their literal meaning became apparent to him only to this extent.","Jake Brancatella"
"1061770","1064450"," For he was not deeply engaged in rational inquiry.","Jake Brancatella"
"1064830","1073910"," Had he delved deeply, it would have also become apparent to him regarding the attribute of aboveness and other aspects that he did not interpret.","Jake Brancatella"
"1074110","1083670"," So even Al-Ghazali, the Ash'ari scholar, is saying that Imam Ahmed did not interpret anything related to the Qur'an and Sunnah except three hadiths.","Jake Brancatella"
"1083730","1085490"," I can respond to those things, but it doesn't matter.","Jake Brancatella"
"1085730","1088370"," He affirmed everything on its apparent meaning.","Jake Brancatella"
"1088790","1095450"," And according to the Ash'aris, this is a curse of Allah upon the so-called Hashawiya.","Jake Brancatella"
"1095590","1097550"," Anyway, I'll get to other points later on.","Jake Brancatella"
"1097610","1098310"," Thank you very much.","Jake Brancatella"
"1099150","1099670"," All right.","Host"
"1099690","1101670"," Now to you, Brother Daniel, for your opening statement.","Host"
"1148180","1151840"," Bismillah, alhamdulillah, wa salatu wa salam ala rasulillah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1152960","1158840"," Today, many Muslims call themselves Salafi, but Salafism is not a monolith.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1159000","1164900"," It draws on figures like Ahmed ibn Hanbal, ibn Taymiyyah, and ibn Abdul-Wahhab.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1165240","1167080"," Yet these influences are not equal.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1167660","1172600"," Those who primarily follow ibn Hanbal or ibn Taymiyyah are not, by definition, Wahhabis.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1173220","1176020"," Wahhabism begins where ibn Abdul-Wahhab begins.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1176020","1183840"," His followers inherit an ultra-sectarian theology fixated on takfir over issues of aqidah and alleged shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1184640","1187360"," Unfortunately, Jake fits this pattern exactly.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1187720","1190160"," He's a textbook Wahhabi takfiri.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1191000","1195940"," Contemporary Wahhabis insist that aqidah is the most important part of Islam.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1196800","1202500"," Yet they defend this creed by attacking the overwhelming majority of Sunni scholarship.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1202500","1211800"," On this basis, Jake declares the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools deviant or outright kafir and excludes them from Ahlus Sunnah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1212360","1215560"," I, on the other hand, categorically reject this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1216560","1219200"," Not because I'm Ash'ari or Maturidi myself.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1219380","1224560"," In fact, in aqidah, I follow the Athari or Hanbali school because I believe it's the closest to the truth.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1225020","1232060"," But Atharis, Ash'aris, and Maturidis are all human scholars, and humans can make errors, including in theology.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1232060","1248600"," Such errors may be forgiven by Allah's permission under al-udhur, either al-udhur bil-ta'wil or al-udhur bil-jahl, meaning the excuse of interpretation or the excuse of ignorance.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1249000","1266900"," Even if the error reaches the level of a bid'ah or even if it reaches the level of kufr, forgiveness remains possible so long as these scholars are overall committed to sound ijtihad rooted in the Quran, hadith, and the Arabic language, and don't violate the core foundations of iman.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1267560","1275320"," Muslims, therefore, may follow Athari, Ash'ari, and Maturidi scholars except where clear proof establishes error.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1275880","1288580"," Ironically, while Wahhabis obsess over kicking Ash'aris and Maturidis outside of Ahlus Sunnah, their own methodology is full of significant errors that make them more akin to the Khawarij rather than orthodox Sunnis.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1289560","1291660"," So the first Wahhabi error.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1291760","1293180"," I'm going to give you five errors.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1293400","1294260"," This is the first one.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1294360","1297740"," Rejection or minimization of the concept of jama'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1298300","1305440"," Insha'Allah, Wahhabis claim that authentic Islam is grounded in the Quran, hadith, and the views of the Salaf.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1305440","1311440"," What's missing is any serious regard for the jama'ah, the broad body of the Muslim community.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1312120","1314460"," Sunnism was never just about Ahlus Sunnah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1314980","1317240"," It's Ahlus Sunnah wal jama'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1317600","1319120"," The jama'ah isn't optional.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1319540","1330340"," It means Muslims are obligated to preserve religious and political unity, to remain one ummah, and to resist splintering into warring theological sects.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"

"1393540","1405660"," That's the historical position of the Khawarij and the Shi'a and the Mu'tazila, and it was revived in the 18th century by Ibn Abdul Wahhab, who takfired most of the Muslim world and declared jihad against it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"

"1602160","1607100"," On one side, periods of fitna marked by hostility, factionalism, and escalating takfir.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1607560","1610440"," On the other, periods of tolerance and coexistence.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1610440","1615940"," Wahhabis just justify their own takfirism by citing these periods of fitna.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1616680","1619580"," During the era of the salaf, there were major fitnas.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1619740","1624320"," The first and second civil wars where sahaba and the tabi'een fought and killed one another.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1624520","1631380"," And later, the mihna when the abbasid state, the mu'tazila, and the ahl al-hadith were locked in theological warfare.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1631960","1636040"," During the mihna, takfir intensified on all sides.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1636040","1642580"," Ahl al-hadith figures persecuted anyone suspected of being a jahmi or mu'tazila.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1642900","1652120"," Major scholars like Imam Bukhari and Muslim were attacked as lofti's, and al-tabari, and abu al-hassan al-ashari were accused and harassed relentlessly.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1652820","1656820"," Abu Hanifa and his followers were denounced as heretics.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1658020","1661160"," But that fitna, that period of fitna, is not the whole story.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1661160","1668520"," After the second fitna, ahl al-hadith preached reconciliation, urging muslims to withhold judgment over past conflicts.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1668820","1676720"," They also gradually recognized figures that they had previously denounced, like Abu Hanifa, Tabari, Bukhari, and Muslim as central pillars of sunnism.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1677140","1683860"," By the 11th century, sunni schools were increasingly tolerant of one another, influenced by figures like al-ghazali and Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1684340","1694720"," That trajectory continued until the 18th century, when al-safarini explicitly affirmed athari, ashari, and ma'turidi creeds as falling within ahl al-sunnah wal-jama'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1694860","1703420"," Yet that same century also saw a new fitna, the rise of wahhabism, marked by mass takfir and jihad against non-wahhabi muslims, especially the ottomans.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1704000","1707080"," Wahhabis selectively mine all this history.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1707260","1718040"," They find takfiri statements from scholars in the times of fitna, and falsely claim that they represent the true position of the salaf, while ignoring the historical periods of reconciliation and tolerance.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1718560","1731600"," This is as stupid as saying that the true salafi position would be that we should insult and want to kill the various sahaba, because the sahaba themselves insulted and killed one another during the first fitna after the death of the prophet ﷺ.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1732140","1737540"," When confronted with that implication, wahhabis suddenly tell us not to dwell on fitna.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1737540","1743260"," But then they turn around and demand that we stay stuck in the world of their preferred fitna.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1748600","1752640"," Islam distinguishes between primary and secondary matters of aqidah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1753080","1757540"," Every muslim must know the primary essentials of aqidah, namely the six pillars of iman.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1758000","1762140"," But there are also secondary aqidah issues that aren't required for salvation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1762660","1768500"," They aren't stated clearly in the Quran or in mutawatir hadith, and the sahaba gave them little to no attention.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1769200","1774700"," Most disputes over Allah's attributes, i.e. the sifat, fall into this secondary category.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1775700","1787280"," These include claims like the Quran is uncreated, that one's recitation of the Quran is uncreated, that Allah literally created Adam with two hands, or that Allah has a literal shin he'll uncover on the day of judgment.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1787700","1791340"," The sahaba avoided these questions because they don't matter for salvation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1791340","1796080"," Following them, the early ahlul hadith also refused to speak on these matters.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1796480","1800360"," Furthermore, they considered excessive discussion of these topics as a bid'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1800920","1805540"," For example, it's reported that Imam Malik was asked about the saying of Allah, the most merciful rose above the throne.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1805880","1807560"," Someone asked, how is his rising?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1808300","1814620"," Malik said, the rising is acknowledged, its modality is unknown, and asking about it is an innovation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1815240","1818440"," I see that you are a man who intended evil with this question.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1818440","1825700"," During the mihna, the government attempted to impose the mu'tazili view of Allah's attributes on Muslims.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1826240","1832600"," So the ahlul hadith spoke on the attributes to counter this, because there was a need to do so.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1833040","1844860"," It's reported that Ibn Hanbal said, we used to believe that it was best to remain silent on this matter of the Quran's createdness, before these people, the jahmiya, engaged in it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1844980","1850500"," But when they openly proclaimed it, we found no alternative but to oppose them and refute their claims.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1851140","1861180"," Unlike the early ahlul hadith, contemporary wahhabis insist Muslims must fixate on these secondary aqidah issues, especially Allah's attributes, even when there's no need.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1861760","1872440"," They demand endless discussion despite the fact that no government is imposing views on Allah's attributes, and despite the fact that the Muslim community honestly doesn't care about these debates.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1873140","1874600"," Look at our reality today.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1874600","1880340"," Today's governments impose liberalism, secularism, atheism, feminism, and related ideologies.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1880760","1892800"," If Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and the early ahlul hadith were alive today, they wouldn't be obsessing over speculative debates about the sifat, they'd be confronting the ideologies actively damaging Muslim belief and practice.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1893420","1903480"," Wahhabis argue the opposite, because the early ahlul hadith once upon a time debated Allah's attributes, that must mean that the attributes must matter more than modern ideologies.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1903480","1913740"," On that logic, Muslims should spend their time refuting long-dead Mu'tazili beliefs instead of resisting the forces that are terrorizing Islam today.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1914260","1916320"," This isn't accidental, by the way.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1916640","1928380"," Liberal secular dictators encourage wahhabis to adopt this strategy because they prefer Muslims wasting all their time debating archaic Mu'tazili views rather than challenge liberalization and secularization.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1928380","1939880"," So the problem with wahhabism isn't just the bid'ah of obsessing over secondary aqidah, it's that in practice they've become de facto agents of liberal secular governments, government policies, and Muslim societies.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1940520","1943640"," Fourth error involving the masses and secondary aqidah matters.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1944020","1951180"," The classical ulama agreed the masses must be taught the fundamentals of aqidah, but not secondary issues, especially debates over Allah's attributes.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1951420","1953060"," They rejected this for two reasons.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1953320","1958920"," These issues aren't necessary for salvation, and ordinary people lack the knowledge to handle these topics without falling into major errors.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1959360","1963860"," For example, the Ahl al-Hadith compiled hadith of varying authenticity like the following.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1964540","1967840"," When Allah sits on the throne, it squeaks like a leather saddle.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1968620","1972360"," Allah is seen in the form of a beardless youth with curly hair.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1973540","1977620"," Allah created angels from the light or the hair of his arms and chest.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1978640","1987600"," Evaluating these reports requires expert hadith criticism, deep mastery of Arabic rhetoric and metaphor, skills the general public simply doesn't have.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1987880","1995380"," Without that knowledge, a person can commit outright blasphemy by affirming a weak report literally and saying Allah is a beardless youth with curly hair.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"1995800","2002340"," To prevent this harm, the early Ahl al-Hadith kept these discussions away from the masses, and other Sunni scholars agreed.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2003040","2012240"," Ghazali made this explicit in his work, restraining the common people from the science of dialectical theology, calling for restraining the masses from speculative theology.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2012660","2014040"," Ibn Taymiyyah held the same position.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2014440","2018780"," When accused of spreading discussions of divine attributes among common people, he denied it outright.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2019300","2020620"," This is mentioned by Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2020900","2032040"," As for the statement of the one who says one should not address the hadiths of the divine attributes and their verses in front of the common people, I have never initiated a discussion with any lay person about any of that at all.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2032680","2046320"," Contrast this with the Wahhabis like Jake, who claimed that all Muslims must speak and preach on secondary aqidah matters like Allah's attributes, and if you don't do this, they're going to make a tier list rating you as an F-tier deviant, call you a grifter who only cares about money, and initiate a boycott against you.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2046880","2050500"," Fifth error, refusing to acknowledge context in determining the limits of orthodoxy.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2050739","2053800"," Ibn Taymiyyah emphasizes context in judging orthodoxy.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2054480","2060639"," He argues that in eras of high knowledge, like the time of the Salaf, there's little excuse for holding views amounting to bid'ah or kufr.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2060960","2064239"," Errors are judged harshly, but knowledge declines over time.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2064500","2070659"," Later scholars facing less informed communities have more excuses for their errors, and their ijtihad is judged more leniently.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2070940","2076760"," Views that would once have branded someone a kafir or deviant, no longer carry the same weight.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2077080","2085199"," That's why Ibn Taymiyyah is so forgiving and respectful of later scholars, including Ash'aris, even when they hold positions that were considered kufr in the time of the jahmiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2085800","2095520"," In one quote, Ibn Taymiyyah explains this clearly, the Salaf takfir jahmiyyah with little restraint because the general Muslim population was highly knowledgeable, but later generations shouldn't be as harshly judged.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2095520","2103600"," Ibn Taymiyyah says, when time grew long, what had been apparent to them, meaning the earliest Muslims, became hidden to many people.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2103700","2109300"," Yet even so, they, meaning the scholars from the later generations, were mujtahids, who were excused.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2109780","2112780"," Allah forgave their errors and rewards them for their ijtihad.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2112960","2120220"," And it may be that in terms of good deeds, a doer among them has the reward of 50 men who performed it in that earlier time.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2120420","2126740"," For they, the early Muslims, used to find those who would help them, whereas these later ones have not found anyone to help them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2126920","2133740"," For Ibn Taymiyyah, context isn't just about how much knowledge exists in a society, it's also about what competing Muslim groups are actually present.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2133900","2136760"," Orthodoxy is judged relationally, not in a vacuum.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2137140","2150520"," In a society made up entirely of Ahl al-Hadith, Ash'aris, and Ma'turidis, may count as deviants, but in a society where the alternatives are 12 rashis or mu'tazilis, those same Ash'aris and Ma'turidis fall squarely within Ahl al-Sunnah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2150520","2153400"," This is what Ibn Taymiyyah says explicitly in one quote.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2153740","2158820"," So if we actually apply Ibn Taymiyyah's framework, should Ash'aris and Ma'turidis count as Ahl al-Sunnah in the modern world?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2158980","2160380"," The answer is clearly yes.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2160940","2163580"," Today, basic Islamic knowledge is at historic lows.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2163940","2171040"," Muslim societies are saturated with liberalized and secularized currents whose deviations are far more severe than those of the Twelvers or the Mu'tazila.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2171360","2175240"," In that context, Ash'aris and Ma'turidis are not the problem.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2175520","2181460"," Their errors can be excused, and relative to the alternatives, they represent Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2181700","2189040"," Yet despite this, Wahhabis like Jake still insist on expelling them from Sunnism, flatly contradicting Ibn Taymiyyah's own method.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"

"2209940","2210460"," I was locked in.","Host"
"2210460","2214660"," I had to try to remind myself, especially after so many hours.","Host"
"2251280","2262980"," Okay, so as I expected, Daniel spent a lot of time on this issue of tech fear and declaring people disbelievers and deviants and all of that.","Jake Brancatella"
"2263380","2265180"," That's not what this debate is about.","Jake Brancatella"
"2265180","2282280"," This debate is about the creeds of the Ash'aris and Ma'turidis, meaning are their positions that they hold on usul, the fundamentals of aqidah, are they actually deviant or are they acceptable differences of opinion?","Jake Brancatella"
"2282740","2295820"," I provided evidence from both Ahl al-Hadith and from Ash'ari and Ma'turidi scholars showing clearly that they do not accept each other's positions as merely differences like the schools of fiqh.","Jake Brancatella"
"2296080","2298320"," No, they're actually fundamental differences.","Jake Brancatella"
"2299660","2308100"," He keeps making this ridiculous claim that the overwhelming Muslim ummah is Ash'ari and Ma'turidi.","Jake Brancatella"
"2308300","2308980"," They're not at all.","Jake Brancatella"
"2309000","2311940"," I'm going to provide some evidences for that in just a second.","Jake Brancatella"
"2312640","2322300"," He also stated that the Qur'an being uncreated is merely a secondary matter and yet he's calling himself an athiri?","Jake Brancatella"
"2323080","2325500"," Where are you getting this from?","Jake Brancatella"
"2325960","2331080"," That the Qur'an being uncreated or created is merely a secondary matter?","Jake Brancatella"
"2332100","2334260"," He's just completely downplaying this.","Jake Brancatella"
"2334380","2337600"," He's saying, look, the Salafis are all focused on aqidah.","Jake Brancatella"
"2337700","2341980"," Yeah, because we don't want to get stuck worshipping other than Allah like Daniel.","Jake Brancatella"
"2343060","2354960"," He mentions these different hadith about Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala supposedly appearing as a bearded youth and he's blaming the scholars of hadith for this.","Jake Brancatella"
"2355620","2367620"," Actually, Ash'ari scholars like al-Suyuti accept this and they say there's nothing wrong with it whatsoever because it's referring to Allah being seen in a dream.","Jake Brancatella"
"2367980","2370940"," It's not saying that he actually looks or appears this way.","Jake Brancatella"
"2373220","2389280"," He's saying that I'm not following Ibn Taymiyyah's methodology or his position but Ibn Taymiyyah definitively considered the views of the Ash'aris and Maturidis as deviant and in some cases their positions to be kufr.","Jake Brancatella"
"2389480","2399200"," He literally wrote a book which in its title appears to be against the jahmiyyah but yet it's actually a book refuting arazi.","Jake Brancatella"
"2399200","2402380"," So he's calling arazi a jahmi.","Jake Brancatella"
"2403260","2405860"," So, I mean, I don't know what you're talking about, Daniel.","Jake Brancatella"
"2405860","2410100"," You seem to not understand what Ibn Taymiyyah's position actually is.","Jake Brancatella"
"2410260","2415880"," Now, let's see what Imam al-Bukhari says about Allah's speech since Daniel says it's merely a secondary matter.","Jake Brancatella"
"2416180","2421940"," He says this is evidence that Allah's voice, Allah has a voice, is unlike the voices of creation.","Jake Brancatella"
"2422360","2430300"," For his voice, glorified be his mention, is heard equally from afar as from near and the angels are overcome by it.","Jake Brancatella"
"2432820","2440240"," Again, you keep mentioning that the lay people, the majority, that the Wahhabis are tech-fearing the majority of the ummah.","Jake Brancatella"
"2440320","2442460"," No, that's the Ash'aris, bro.","Jake Brancatella"
"2442860","2445120"," They're the ones who tech-fear most of the ummah.","Jake Brancatella"
"2445380","2470240"," As Sanusi says about the lay people, as for the masses, most of them being those who do not regularly attend scholars' gatherings or associate with the people of virtue, hold beliefs such as anthropomorphism, the affirmation of direction, which Ghazali just attributed to Imam Ahmed, the influence of nature, that Allah's actions are for a purpose.","Jake Brancatella"
"2470540","2470920"," Wow!","Jake Brancatella"
"2471100","2472580"," Who doesn't believe that?","Jake Brancatella"
"2472660","2477640"," The Ash'aris do, but most people believe that there's a reason for why things happen in the world.","Jake Brancatella"
"2477780","2494340"," That his speech, exalted and glorified, consists of letters and sounds, as al-Bukhari just said, and that he sometimes speaks and sometimes remains silent like humans, like when he spoke to Musa alayhis salaam after not having spoken to him and then stopped speaking to him.","Jake Brancatella"
"2494760","2498560"," Such beliefs resemble those of the people of falsehood.","Jake Brancatella"
"2499000","2510500"," Scholars have unanimously agreed upon some of these beliefs as constituting kufr, as constituting disbelief, while others are subjects of scholarly disagreement.","Jake Brancatella"
"2511060","2521480"," So al-Sanusi is explicitly saying that most of the lay people are not Ash'ari and Maturidi and actually hold kufri beliefs and he lists what some of them are.","Jake Brancatella"
"2523320","2525940"," You wanted to speak earlier about a companion.","Jake Brancatella"
"2526080","2528620"," What about al-Razi, how he speaks of Abu Hurayrah?","Jake Brancatella"
"2529820","2535260"," He says, as for Abu Hurayrah, he only served the Prophet for a short period.","Jake Brancatella"
"2535260","2547520"," He himself was not superior in intelligence and acumen to Abu Bakr and Ali, yet he narrated over 2,000 reports, constituting half of the authentic hadiths.","Jake Brancatella"
"2547680","2549900"," This indicates significant doubts.","Jake Brancatella"
"2550320","2558560"," Now because al-Razi and the Ash'aris actually have problems with hadiths, they have to cast doubt on Abu Hurayrah himself.","Jake Brancatella"
"2559080","2562460"," So Dan, don't talk to me about how we treat the companions.","Jake Brancatella"
"2562460","2569040"," And the last quote that I'll read is from Asubqi, who literally calls the ethities idol worshippers.","Jake Brancatella"
"2569520","2581480"," The greatest calamity and the most grievous disaster is to pass over the apparent meaning of the texts and to believe that it is the intended meaning and that it is not impossible for Allah.","Jake Brancatella"
"2582000","2593800"," This is the belief of the corporealists, the idol worshippers, whose hearts are deviant and their deviance leads them to follow ambiguous texts seeking discord.","Jake Brancatella"
"2594240","2604980"," May the curses of Allah be upon them one after another, how bold they are in lying and how little they understand the facts.","Jake Brancatella"
"2605260","2624260"," So since you love Asubqi so much, and since Asubqi says that the Hashawiya are those who actually interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah upon their apparent meaning, and then he says may Allah curse those people who he calls and knows are Ahl al-Hadith, I'd like for you to deal with this quote from Asubqi, Dan.","Jake Brancatella"
"2624440","2625260"," Thank you very much.","Host"
"2627650","2632590"," And now to Daniel for your rebuttal to his opening statement.","Host"
"2643110","2644390"," No, I don't need the slides.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2645190","2654430"," So again, Jake keeps emphasizing that this is not about takfir, but you takfir the Ash'aris and Maturidis.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2655350","2657150"," I mean, we've posted the tweet.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2657290","2666190"," I don't know if you retracted it at any point, but you said that the Ash'aris and Maturidis are kafir, murtad, and they deserve to be executed as long as they don't have the excuse for ignorance.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2666750","2670290"," You publicly go out and say that, and then you claim that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2670750","2672410"," I mean, it's a tweet.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2673110","2676290"," That's verbatim what it says, and I've posted it many times.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2676570","2680630"," I don't know if you've backtracked, or maybe you were just speaking in a kind of majaz way.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2680630","2684930"," But so let's see.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2685290","2694350"," So you say that, oh, Daniel calls himself an Athari, but he doesn't care about the createdness or uncreatedness of the Quran.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2694750","2695430"," Ha, ha, ha.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2695450","2700430"," How can Daniel consider himself an Athari or a follower of Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2700610","2703030"," But I read you the quote from Imam Ahmed.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2703430","2709630"," Imam Ahmed didn't say that, oh, we have to go and debate the createdness of the Quran.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2709630","2713390"," He actually says, we were silent on these matters.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2713830","2715870"," We were silent on them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2716810","2718150"," What do you make of that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2718350","2728230"," The clear implication is that Imam Ahmed would never talk about the createdness of the Quran or the uncreatedness of the Quran and what does that entail.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2728530","2730090"," He wouldn't even get into that issue.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2730310","2733650"," He only got into that issue because he had no choice.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2733950","2742510"," There was a government there, the Abbasids, who were forcing it on the people, forcing it and requiring them to accept this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2742550","2743990"," So he had to do something.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2744790","2745670"," That's the only reason.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2745790","2747690"," Otherwise, he prefers silence.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2748010","2749510"," He prefers silence.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2749830","2751810"," So yeah, I am a true Hanbali.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2751910","2753570"," I am a true follower of Imam Ahmed.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2753730","2754310"," You're not.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2754550","2755710"," You're not actually.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2757570","2772870"," We will probably have to talk about the sifat at one point and these narrations that are passed along by the Ahl al-Hadith, those who are pejoratively called the Hashwiya, but you give Ibn Taymiyyah's explanation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2773270","2775050"," Like, okay, here's a hadith.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2775230","2777730"," Allah is a curly-haired youth.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2778710","2784690"," And narrations like this, and you give Ibn Taymiyyah's interpretation that, well, this is just a vision.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2784950","2785730"," This is a vision.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2786090","2787150"," It has no reality.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2787690","2793210"," And the critique that people will make against Ibn Taymiyyah, and maybe you can talk about that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2793210","2801150"," I'm sure you're more knowledgeable on this issue, is that, well, Ibn Taymiyyah, why are these hadith, you're not doing ithbat on them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2801190","2806550"," You're not affirming them that, yes, Allah is a curly-haired youth, but we just don't know the kayfiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2806930","2809410"," Like, why don't you do that with the other attributes of Allah?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2809790","2811170"," Why not do it with the hand of Allah?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2811870","2816090"," So this is something that is easily responded to, to the critics of Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2817110","2818110"," But let's see.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2818370","2821170"," Ash'ari's takfir most of the ummah is one of your claims.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2821170","2826730"," I don't know any ash'ari's who have takfir'd me, actually, or written a joint statement against me.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2827330","2834770"," It wasn't any ash'ari's who had me retake my shahada, you know, in front of people.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2834850","2836470"," It wasn't any ash'ari's who were doing that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2836630","2842950"," They all fell into one category of group, one category, and they're not ash'ari's or maturidi's, okay?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2843070","2848970"," So this claim that ash'ari's are doing the most takfir of the entire ummah, we're not seeing that today.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2848970","2850590"," That's not our context.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2851310","2857010"," And when we do actually see, people will point out, oh, but I do see a really sectarian ash'ari online.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2857730","2858890"," These people are reacting.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2859290","2865150"," Like, the Wahhabis harass ash'ari's to such an extent that, of course, you're going to get a reaction.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2865350","2867290"," Of course, you're going to get a sectarian response.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2867510","2872190"," It's because of the Wahhabis pushing this, pushing all of these nonsense issues.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2872410","2878870"," And, look, this is not an insult against the content of what you presented, Jake, in your presentation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2879030","2880330"," It seemed very erudite.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2880470","2883670"," You're bringing all these quotes, and I clearly spent a lot of time on it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2883950","2884690"," But let's be honest.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2885550","2890550"," What percentage of the audience actually understood, like, what you're talking about or could follow?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2891330","2893410"," One guy did, 100%, okay?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2893730","2895190"," 100% of the audience here.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2895650","2898750"," But other than that, people aren't following this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2898830","2900890"," People aren't getting what you're talking about.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2901030","2903430"," And you're telling them that, oh, this is the most important thing.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2903510","2904550"," We have to talk about this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2904630","2904930"," We have to.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2904930","2908870"," And if you don't talk about it, we're going to denounce you.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2909050","2910610"," We're going to denounce you.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2910710","2914290"," We're going to actually disassociate from you.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2914450","2915750"," We're going to call you F-tier.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2915970","2917930"," We're going to say you don't have the right aqeedah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2917990","2923090"," We're going to say that you are just a grifter because you're too scared to talk about these issues.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2923690","2924970"," Like, come on, bro.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2925030","2925850"," This is ridiculous.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2926130","2930330"," Like no one is following any of this discussion because it's out of date.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2930490","2931470"," It's not relevant.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2931470","2935130"," We need to go back to Ibn Hanbal's position, Imam Ahmed.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2935370","2936210"," We're silent.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2936470","2939410"," We need to be silent on these things and worry about the real challenges.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2939650","2942150"," Do you know what the government is actually imposing on people?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2942670","2946850"," It's not a certain definition of the sifat of Allah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2947170","2948430"," They're imposing liberalism.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2948630","2949530"," They're imposing feminism.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2949790","2950850"," They're imposing atheism.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2951090","2953430"," They're imposing this kind of scientific materialism.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2953570","2954710"," That's what's being imposed.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2955070","2955930"," That's what we need to do.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2955990","2959810"," If we want to follow Imam Ahmed, those are the things that we need to address.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2959810","2963590"," We need to write books on and actually engage in these debates.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2963770","2965510"," So this is all a waste of time.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2968960","2987670"," Now we can move to discussions starting with – Yeah, so Dan, do you think that the position of the Quran, the Arabic Quran being makhluq, created, is that a bidah or kufr?","Jake Brancatella"
"2988790","2990250"," Or is it an acceptable position?","Jake Brancatella"
"2991510","2994470"," No, I think it's not acceptable to believe that the Quran is created.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"2994470","2995190"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"2995490","2997010"," What status does it have?","Jake Brancatella"
"2997130","2997590"," Is it bidah?","Jake Brancatella"
"2999010","3001170"," It's a bidah and it can reach kufr, yeah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3001930","3002250"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"3002450","3005790"," Is this the mainstream position of asharis and matureedis?","Jake Brancatella"
"3006990","3007790"," I don't know.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3008310","3008890"," You don't know?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3009430","3012350"," The mainstream asharis of today and the past?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3012570","3014390"," I'm talking about the scholarly position.","Jake Brancatella"
"3014690","3016430"," I'm not talking about ashari on the street.","Jake Brancatella"
"3016730","3017450"," They don't know any of this.","Jake Brancatella"
"3017730","3020610"," I'm saying the mainstream scholarly ashari position.","Jake Brancatella"
"3020610","3023650"," Is it that the Arabic Quran is created?","Jake Brancatella"
"3025170","3027290"," I think that they hold that as uncreated.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3027990","3028270"," They do?","Jake Brancatella"
"3028390","3029690"," Can you give one evidence for that?","Jake Brancatella"
"3030030","3030450"," I don't know.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3030530","3033750"," Like I said, I haven't studied this, and I don't care to study it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3034330","3035290"," That's the whole point.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3035450","3039590"," So you can sit there and aqidah check me, go through a whole list of these questions.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3040070","3040670"," Why are you getting nervous?","Jake Brancatella"
"3040750","3042450"," I'm asking you a normal question.","Jake Brancatella"
"3043510","3044910"," Engage in my point.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3045310","3048510"," You can feel free to aqidah test me.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3048510","3053550"," But that will just prove my entire argument that this stuff is not relevant.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3053730","3057830"," And if it's, yeah, go ahead and ask whatever you want.","Jake Brancatella"
"3057990","3058130"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"3058330","3060770"," So al-Jorjani says here, it's on there.","Jake Brancatella"
"3061110","3075250"," Know that what the maqtazala say about the speech of Allah, namely, that it consists of created sounds and letters indicating intended meanings and that these are occurrences existing apart from his essence, is something we agree with.","Jake Brancatella"
"3075250","3079450"," There is no dispute between us and them on this matter.","Jake Brancatella"
"3079970","3083490"," Many Ash'ari and Maturidi scholars admit this.","Jake Brancatella"
"3084190","3093590"," As a modern example, there are Ash'ari scholars who openly state that the Arabic Qur'an is created.","Jake Brancatella"
"3094070","3101570"," There's not any Ash'ari scholars who do not believe that the Arabic Qur'an is makhluq.","Jake Brancatella"
"3101670","3102710"," They all believe this.","Jake Brancatella"
"3103490","3113090"," So that is a fundamental view that they hold, and you're admitting that you believe that that position is a bid'ah that can actually reach the level of kufr.","Jake Brancatella"
"3113370","3116930"," So how is their school and their creed actually not deviant?","Jake Brancatella"
"3117870","3126890"," I mean, I explained this in the previous series of debates that scholars, like just let's assume that what you're presenting about the Ash'aris is accurate.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3127050","3127890"," That's a big assumption.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3127890","3130310"," Because you're a polemicist.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3130570","3133530"," You want to portray them in the worst way possible.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3134030","3140470"," But let's just assume that your portrayal is actually accurate and that they hold a part of their creed does include kufr.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3140770","3146030"," We addressed this repeatedly in the previous debate, and you just can't cope with that fact.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3146270","3161510"," Where I say I acknowledge that you can have a creed or you can have a book or you can have a statement from one of these major scholars, from the khalaf, and it could be kufr, and they're excused for that, and we still respect them and we still consider them part of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3161770","3163050"," That's the principle that I gave.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3163230","3166390"," And I cited Ibn Taymiyyah also applying that principle.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3167030","3170230"," Ibn Taymiyyah also applies that principle in the quotes that I read.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3170870","3180590"," Because I anticipated exactly this type of open discussion of you asking me these very archaic questions and then trying to trap me in nothing.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3180590","3183990"," But that's proving my point.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3184250","3188010"," You're engaging in a kind of dialectic that is obsolete.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3188550","3191250"," This is something from over a thousand years ago.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3191370","3196570"," It's not relevant to our time, and it doesn't actually determine if you're going to go into Jannah or not.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3197230","3222270"," Okay, so what about the position that I presented in my opening statement, the mainstream Ash'ari position, of saying that they must go through this process of the mutakallim to prove that God exists from a rational standpoint, and they can't just say they believe in Islam and follow their religion, and that that belief of doing so is invalid.","Jake Brancatella"
"3222670","3227130"," Is that a position that you accept as genuine, or is it a bid'ah?","Jake Brancatella"
"3227890","3230450"," I question that interpretation of Razi.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3230450","3234150"," I think that's a very uncharitable interpretation of Fakhr ad-Din al-Razi.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3234350","3245130"," I think that this is more akin to what the philosophers say, and we know that the philosophers are refuted by the later Ash'aris, starting from Imam Ghazali and then all the way to Fakhr ad-Din al-Razi.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3245690","3249750"," So this, I think, is an uncharitable reading of Fakhr ad-Din al-Razi.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3250030","3252650"," But again, if he had this kind of mistaken view,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3252810","3256210"," and I completely concede your interpretation of Razi,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3256210","3259990"," I'll say that was a mistake from one scholar,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3260070","3262090"," one important scholar within the Ash'ari school,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3262310","3264510"," and it might even reach the level of bid'ah,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3264590","3266290"," it might reach the level of something being kufr,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3266610","3269670"," but that doesn't change the fact that he is a respected,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3270090","3273730"," loved, important figure of Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jama'ah,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3273810","3275370"," part of the khalaf who was accepted.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3275630","3283030"," His tafsir is read and is taught throughout the world to this day, and that's something that has a lot of weight.","Jake Brancatella"
"3283950","3285150"," Yeah, but this is not.","Jake Brancatella"
"3285290","3299430"," I quoted al-Ju'ayni, and I also quoted al-Nawawi, who discusses this, and he says, he is not obligated to learn the mutakallimun's proofs and know Allah through them.","Jake Brancatella"
"3299790","3312390"," This contradicts those who insist that it is obligatory and a condition for being considered among the people of the qibla, claiming that one cannot be deemed a Muslim without it.","Jake Brancatella"
"3312870","3320490"," This view is held by many Mu'tazilites and some of our mutakallimun, but it is evidently incorrect.","Jake Brancatella"
"3320870","3330230"," So al-Nawawi is saying that this is a mainstream position of the mutakallimun referring, he says, our referring to the Ash'aris and Maturidis.","Jake Brancatella"
"3330590","3352890"," So do you accept this as merely a ikhtilaf and genuine difference of opinion, or is it to say that most of the ummah who you agree with don't do this, they don't go through these complicated rational proofs of the mutakallimun, to say that their iman is not valid without doing it and they can't be considered Muslim without doing that.","Jake Brancatella"
"3353090","3355010"," Is that position a bid'ah?","Jake Brancatella"
"3357100","3362140"," Again, assuming that your presentation is correct, I can say, yeah, it's a bid'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3362380","3362940"," This is what al-Nawawi says.","Jake Brancatella"
"3363500","3367920"," al-Nawawi can have a bid'ah, he can promote a bid'ah, he can promote a kufr view.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3368100","3370880"," No, no, he's saying that this is the view of the mutakallimun.","Jake Brancatella"
"3371040","3372340"," He's not saying it's his view.","Jake Brancatella"
"3372440","3375540"," He's saying it's a view that they hold, and he's saying it's wrong.","Jake Brancatella"
"3376160","3379400"," I'm saying it's not Jake's representation of them.","Jake Brancatella"
"3379500","3382300"," This is al-Nawawi's representation of them.","Jake Brancatella"
"3383120","3385160"," Do you consider Ghazali part of the mutakallimun?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3385460","3385680"," Yeah.","Jake Brancatella"
"3386640","3388080"," So he's condemning himself?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3388920","3390280"," Or he's representing himself?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3390440","3391300"," I'm trying to understand.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3391320","3395660"," This is al-Nawawi talking about the beliefs of the mutakallimun.","Jake Brancatella"
"3395660","3396100"," What do you mean?","Jake Brancatella"
"3397680","3400000"," Okay, is al-Nawawi part of the mutakallimun?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3400600","3401000"," No.","Jake Brancatella"
"3401880","3402280"," No?","Jake Brancatella"
"3403000","3403960"," No, not at all.","Jake Brancatella"
"3403980","3404240"," Why?","Jake Brancatella"
"3404900","3407000"," Not at all, because he doesn't engage in this stuff.","Jake Brancatella"
"3407100","3408200"," He was not a mutakallim.","Jake Brancatella"
"3409160","3409780"," Al-Nawawi?","Jake Brancatella"
"3410000","3410400"," Al-Nawawi?","Jake Brancatella"
"3410600","3412680"," Al-Nawawi was not a mutakallim.","Jake Brancatella"
"3412800","3413380"," No, not at all.","Jake Brancatella"
"3413400","3414600"," Yeah, this is what I referred to.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3416100","3419920"," The Wahhabis will just back project that, oh, al-Nawawi was a Wahhabi.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3420120","3421700"," I never said that.","Jake Brancatella"
"3421940","3423520"," He disagreed with kalam.","Jake Brancatella"
"3423520","3425260"," No, he disagreed with kalam.","Jake Brancatella"
"3425420","3433260"," He's disagreeing with a fundamental asal, a fundamental aspect of the principle of the mutakallimun.","Jake Brancatella"
"3433460","3438520"," He's telling you what the context is, what the issue is, and he's saying that they're wrong about this.","Jake Brancatella"
"3439000","3445940"," He's saying this view is held by many mautezalites and some of our mutakallimun, but it is evidently incorrect.","Jake Brancatella"
"3446380","3451420"," He's saying it's wrong, and he's giving the Prophet as an evidence for why it's wrong.","Jake Brancatella"
"3451720","3452840"," He's disagreeing with them.","Jake Brancatella"
"3452840","3455420"," Yeah, so he's saying some of the mutakallimun.","Jake Brancatella"
"3455840","3456380"," Exactly.","Jake Brancatella"
"3456780","3466660"," He's saying some of them, but I'm telling you, it's the mainstream Ash'ari position to say that you must go through this process.","Jake Brancatella"
"3466880","3468500"," That's why I showed you al-Juwaini.","Jake Brancatella"
"3468680","3470040"," This is a quote from al-Juwaini.","Jake Brancatella"
"3470300","3482620"," The first obligation upon a rational adult upon reaching the age of maturity or puberty, according to the Sharia, is to engage in correct contemplation that leads to knowledge of the world's origination.","Jake Brancatella"
"3482900","3484600"," This is a mainstream Ash'ari view.","Jake Brancatella"
"3484840","3488980"," This is not something— This quote, okay, this is in line with the Qur'an's commands.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3489800","3492560"," أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ Are you not people who reason?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3492780","3493880"," Don't you use your aql?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3493980","3494560"," This is reason.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3494720","3495960"," That's not what it's referring to.","Jake Brancatella"
"3496060","3497880"," How do I know what it's referring to?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3497980","3498740"," It's just as reason.","Jake Brancatella"
"3498920","3499920"," It's just as rationality.","Jake Brancatella"
"3499940","3508240"," Because if you look, if you actually look into what the mutakallimun mean by rational proofs, you will see what they're talking about.","Jake Brancatella"
"3508340","3515620"," They're talking about rigorous rational proofs, not just looking outside and seeing a bird and saying, Oh, wow, that's amazing.","Jake Brancatella"
"3515840","3516680"," There must be a creator.","Jake Brancatella"
"3516900","3518000"," That's not what they're talking about.","Jake Brancatella"
"3518200","3518840"," How do we know that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3519200","3520640"," Again, you're a polemicist.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3520940","3523600"," The quote that you just showed me is just talking about rationality.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3524520","3525580"," So this is the point.","Jake Brancatella"
"3525660","3529000"," You're just showing that you don't know what the Ash'ari views are.","Jake Brancatella"
"3529340","3529860"," That's clear.","Jake Brancatella"
"3530020","3531720"," You're showing that you don't know what they are.","Jake Brancatella"
"3531780","3535260"," Because I claimed at the beginning, I said in the beginning, I'm not an Ash'ari.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3535260","3541800"," I also claimed in the beginning and admitted that I don't care to dive into all of these abstruse issues.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3542160","3548800"," I also openly, readily – Don't you think that's important to know whether or not they consider most of the ummah to be Muslim or not?","Jake Brancatella"
"3549040","3549900"," You don't think that's important?","Jake Brancatella"
"3550040","3554580"," Your interpretation in a very uncharitable way is like that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3554620","3562100"," But I don't think that's actually the Ash'ari view, that you have to – if you want to be a true Muslim, the only way you can get into Jannah is if you can run through the contingency argument.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3562100","3568540"," I don't think that's what – I think that's a very uncharitable projection onto the Ash'aris.","Jake Brancatella"
"3568620","3568820"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"3569000","3572520"," So when Sanusi is saying here in this quote, which I read earlier,","Jake Brancatella"
"3572920","3575620"," that the lay people, the awam, the masses,","Jake Brancatella"
"3576140","3580220"," he says they hold beliefs such as anthropomorphism,","Jake Brancatella"
"3580500","3583380"," the affirmation of direction, the influence of nature,","Jake Brancatella"
"3583720","3587360"," that Allah's actions are for a purpose which Ash'aris deny,","Jake Brancatella"
"3587680","3591060"," that his speech, exalted and glorified, consists of letters and sound,","Jake Brancatella"
"3591060","3594420"," and that he sometimes speaks and sometimes remains silent like humans.","Jake Brancatella"
"3594660","3598480"," Such beliefs resemble those of the people of falsehood.","Jake Brancatella"
"3598500","3599800"," He's talking about Muslims.","Jake Brancatella"
"3600400","3603700"," The majority of the masses are upon falsehood.","Jake Brancatella"
"3604120","3611220"," Scholars have unanimously agreed upon some of these beliefs as constituting kufr, this belief.","Jake Brancatella"
"3611560","3618380"," So he's saying that the awam, some of their beliefs constitute kufr, and most of them are upon this.","Jake Brancatella"
"3618780","3619800"," That's what he's saying.","Jake Brancatella"
"3620960","3624960"," Again, I don't think that that in itself is a problematic view.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3625500","3626700"," So you hold that view too?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3627760","3629320"," Let me explain that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3629480","3640000"," Because today you have, I would say, a lot of Muslims, I can't give a percentage, that they do have kufr views because of the influence of liberalism, because of the influence of secularism.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3640280","3650060"," How often do we see Muslims who they think, like some non-Muslim celebrity dies and say, oh, may Allah grant him jannah, and they think that all religions are acceptable.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3650060","3655120"," Those are very clear kufr views that unfortunately are very spread, widespread throughout the ummah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3655560","3662500"," And you could say, I wouldn't say majority, but I'd say it's a very significant segment.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3662900","3664160"," He says as for the masses, most of them.","Jake Brancatella"
"3664180","3664760"," That could be the case.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3664940","3670780"," In the future, it could be the case that most of the ummah has serious kufr issues.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3671000","3673160"," But that's very different than what you claimed earlier.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3673500","3680520"," Your claim earlier was that the Ash'ari say that unless you go through these rationalistic proofs, you cannot go to jannah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3681180","3682740"," This quote doesn't justify that.","Jake Brancatella"
"3683100","3683260"," No.","Jake Brancatella"
"3683520","3691300"," I'm talking about this quote is saying that most of the lay people have kufr beliefs, and he lists a whole bunch of them.","Jake Brancatella"
"3691420","3693120"," Do you believe that these beliefs are kufr?","Jake Brancatella"
"3693520","3695360"," That these positions are kufr, which he mentions?","Jake Brancatella"
"3696500","3696760"," No.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3697220","3698240"," I don't think that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3699500","3701300"," Affirming a direction for Allah.","Jake Brancatella"
"3701540","3702520"," Is that kufr?","Jake Brancatella"
"3703640","3704660"," Affirming a direction for Allah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3704660","3706800"," Yeah, that Allah is above and outside of creation.","Jake Brancatella"
"3707060","3707360"," Is that kufr?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3707360","3708140"," I don't think that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3708360","3709220"," Depending on what you mean.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3709340","3710400"," Depending on what you mean by that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3710520","3723900"," But the point that I'm making is that a scholar can assert based on his ijtihad that the majority of people in a particular time are upon kufr, and he can condemn that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3724320","3725880"," And there's nothing wrong with that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3726120","3729260"," There's nothing problematic or obviously problematic to me about that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3729420","3732460"," You could arguably say that about Muslims today, unfortunately.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3732460","3739940"," Okay, so how are we supposed to actually interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah?","Jake Brancatella"
"3740040","3751800"," Because I gave the quote, this is fundamental, I gave the quote from Razi earlier saying that if the Qur'an or Sunnah contradict reason, then we're supposed to take reason over the Qur'an and Sunnah.","Jake Brancatella"
"3751920","3753000"," So do you agree with that?","Jake Brancatella"
"3754280","3760360"," Yeah, so I mean, Razi, he has this kind of perspective, qanun kulli, that's his principle.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3760360","3763760"," And I agree with Ibn Taymiyyah's critique of that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3764100","3769940"," I agree that we should take reason in its place, aql has its place, and it's a proof.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3770180","3779040"," And also revelation, naql is a proof, and there's no contradiction inherent to true aql and authentic revelation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3779260","3781820"," That's Ibn Taymiyyah's critique, I think that's a brilliant critique.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3782280","3790700"," I think Al-Razi, he might have, he has a mistake, depending on what he means by aql, and we excuse him for that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3790840","3795160"," We excuse that kind of mistake, and that's on the basis of his ijtihad.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3795440","3796400"," There's no problem here.","Jake Brancatella"
"3796460","3799640"," These are fundamental matters of how we interpret a text.","Jake Brancatella"
"3799900","3806860"," He's saying that we take the reason over revelation, and what he means by that are the proofs of the mutikalimun.","Jake Brancatella"
"3806980","3807700"," That's what he means.","Jake Brancatella"
"3808120","3814460"," He's not getting these rational proofs from the Qur'an and Sunnah, he's getting them from Greek metaphysics.","Jake Brancatella"
"3814460","3829480"," The Qur'an is constantly calling us to engage in our reason, to be rational, and criticizes the kuffar, the disbelievers, for not engaging their aql, for not using their aql.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3829680","3855780"," So someone could take that, and take those statements from the Qur'an, and have an interpretation like Al-Razi's, or the other mutikalimun, and again, if we're talking about Al-Razi being some fringe figure, some fringe that everyone rejected, he's been refuted, he has no proof of his fiqh, or his strength, in all these Islamic sciences, that'd be a separate question.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3855900","3856760"," But we're talking about Al-Razi.","Jake Brancatella"
"3857140","3860520"," But just because he's a scholar, Dan, this is the difference.","Jake Brancatella"
"3860980","3868540"," You just see, oh, a scholar says this, so just because a so-called scholar says this, it must be an acceptable difference of opinion.","Jake Brancatella"
"3868780","3871200"," Why should anyone accept this principle?","Jake Brancatella"
"3871340","3872160"," I didn't say that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3872160","3874020"," I just said that it's an acceptable difference of opinion.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3874040","3874980"," But you're talking about because he has this book of tefsir.","Jake Brancatella"
"3874980","3878080"," He is acceptable, and he is respected.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3878080","3880340"," Yeah, but it doesn't mean we accept everything he says.","Jake Brancatella"
"3880360","3880780"," I agree.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3881120","3882480"," Don't accept everything that he says.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3882540","3886560"," I just said that I don't accept the principle, like his qanun kulli.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3886620","3887480"," I don't accept that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3887940","3889980"," But I accept him.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3890260","3891400"," I respect him.","Jake Brancatella"
"3891500","3892240"," That's the difference.","Jake Brancatella"
"3892340","3895140"," Yeah, but we're not discussing people.","Jake Brancatella"
"3895280","3897380"," We are discussing the beliefs.","Jake Brancatella"
"3897480","3901740"," We're talking about the aqidah, the creed of the Ash'aris and Maturidis.","Jake Brancatella"
"3902040","3912420"," And on one hand, it seems like you're agreeing with me that certain aspects, or at least the entailment of the positions being mentioned, is that they are actually bid'ah or could raise to that level.","Jake Brancatella"
"3912760","3921540"," What about, especially in today's day and age, when a lot of Muslims, rightly so, may be kind of wondering what's going on in the world?","Jake Brancatella"
"3921720","3930720"," Why is Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala allowing these very difficult things to take place during our time, like what's happening in Palestine right now?","Jake Brancatella"
"3931120","3935100"," And if an Ash'ari would come to say, well, actually, it doesn't matter.","Jake Brancatella"
"3935560","3938420"," Allah doesn't do anything for any reason at all.","Jake Brancatella"
"3938500","3940400"," Is that an acceptable difference of opinion?","Jake Brancatella"
"3941860","3947200"," Again, this is a polemical recasting of the Ash'ari view.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3947340","3948420"," So that's not the Ash'ari view.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3948440","3961520"," You have to ask an Ash'ari scholar to come, like have that conversation with Sheikh Yasser Hanafi, or take the plunge with the Sheikh from Down Under, as you call him, and talk to Sheikh Harun Kanj, and discuss with them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3961720","3966580"," And I want to see you ask these questions to them and get a qualified scholar's response.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3966600","3967340"," So you don't know the answer?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3967460","3967560"," Me?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3967980","3969060"," I've admitted that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3969180","3969960"," Yeah, I'll admit.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3970120","3971080"," I don't know the answer.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3971540","3972860"," I claim silence.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3972980","3973900"," I plead the fifth.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3974300","3976160"," I plead the fifth on all these issues.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3976340","3976820"," I don't want to incriminate myself.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3976820","3977760"," No, but that's important.","Jake Brancatella"
"3978260","3978920"," It's not.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"3979060","3979420"," It's actually not.","Jake Brancatella"
"3979420","3980260"," No, I'm telling you why.","Jake Brancatella"
"3980380","3980920"," I'm telling you why.","Jake Brancatella"
"3980920","3982260"," It's literally not.","Jake Brancatella"
"3982500","3983220"," You don't have to know.","Jake Brancatella"
"3983220","3983540"," It's literally not.","Jake Brancatella"
"3983660","3984300"," You don't have to know.","Jake Brancatella"
"3984380","3986600"," The reason why it's important for this debate,","Jake Brancatella"
"3986940","3989540"," and you could be exonerated in that respect,","Jake Brancatella"
"3989820","3991380"," is because if the question is,","Jake Brancatella"
"3991680","3994140"," are the Ash'ari and Maturidi creeds deviant,","Jake Brancatella"
"3994380","3996860"," and you're displaying and openly admitting","Jake Brancatella"
"3996860","4000560"," that you don't know a lot of the positions that I'm representing","Jake Brancatella"
"4000560","4003740"," as their positions actually are deviant,","Jake Brancatella"
"4004020","4006740"," then there's probably good reason why you don't think","Jake Brancatella"
"4006740","4009920"," that they're actually deviant or Kufri creeds,","Jake Brancatella"
"4009920","4011980"," because you don't know what they actually believe.","Jake Brancatella"
"4012140","4012780"," That's fair.","Jake Brancatella"
"4013140","4014240"," But then you should just say that.","Jake Brancatella"
"4014340","4016100"," You should just say, I don't know, Jake.","Jake Brancatella"
"4016160","4025260"," I actually want to withhold and say, I don't know if their aqidah, their creeds, actually are deviant or not, because I don't know enough about them.","Jake Brancatella"
"4025380","4027360"," And that would be a more respectable position.","Jake Brancatella"
"4028820","4040040"," The creed, the Ash'ari creed or the Maturidi creed, it's a massive body of work associated with certain books, certain scholars.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4040460","4042780"," It is a huge corpus, right?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4043160","4055380"," And 90, let's say 90%, give a percentage, but it's definitely the vast majority, will agree across, especially between Ash'ari, Maturidi, and Athari.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4056120","4058460"," And this is something that I will claim.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4058880","4063320"," You can dispute it, but you are focusing, like this is the cherry-picking aspect.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4063460","4073840"," You're focusing on points of disagreement, and you're saying that these points of disagreement or these mistakes, they color the entire creed of the Ash'aris or the Maturidis.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4074060","4076760"," You can take that same approach with the Atharis.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4077160","4096060"," This hadith, like affirming, like the Ahlul Hadith will affirm or they'll narrate these hadith about Allah being a curly-haired youth or the angels being made from the hair or the light from Allah's arms and chest, like these types of very anthropomorphic-sounding hadith.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4096060","4099000"," Like they will affirm that, and I think they make mistakes too.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4099120","4102240"," There are some who go too extreme, and you will agree.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4102520","4111960"," You will agree with me that some of these Ahlul Hadith will go too far in affirming a kind of bodily form to Allah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4112100","4113180"," You agree with that, don't you?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4114240","4115300"," Can you give an example?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4115840","4117840"," To literally say that Allah is a curly-haired youth.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4117859","4119120"," I don't think anybody believes that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4119439","4121319"," Yeah, there are those who will...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4121960","4122460"," Okay, fine.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4122760","4124080"," Let me put it this way.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4124080","4127859"," And we'll get to all of this in the next part of the debate,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4128319","4130840"," that when you have Ibn Taymiyyah, for example,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4131800","4135520"," denying the eternality of the hellfire","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4135520","4139060"," or saying at least that's an acceptable belief that someone can have","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4139060","4141600"," or requesting from Jinn what we just talked about,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4141680","4142979"," like these kinds of views,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4143140","4146140"," if I just hyper-focus on those views of Ibn Taymiyyah","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4146140","4148540"," and I say, well, this shows that Ibn Taymiyyah is a deviant,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4148800","4150340"," you obviously wouldn't accept that","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4150340","4154060"," because you don't have a polemical approach to Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4154060","4155000"," You support him.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4155439","4156120"," You support him.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4156220","4158560"," So you're going to have this kind of hosnodvan.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4158819","4163420"," You're going to say, oh, well, even if I don't agree, maybe it's an error, and you move on.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4163540","4165120"," You still consider him Shaykh al-Islam.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4165479","4184920"," That's the approach that you should have for all of these ulama of the khalaf who have been accepted by the khalaf, they've been accepted by the ummah, and Ibn Taymiyyah explicitly, like, I wish you would actually, because you've been testing me, I haven't pushed back, like, when Ibn Taymiyyah says that we have to have a contextual approach, like, what do you think about that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4185000","4185920"," Like, this is so brilliant.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4186080","4187479"," Like, this is why I love Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4187779","4193960"," He is so self-conscious about the fact that we live in very confusing times.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4194160","4196220"," We live in a time of great misguidance.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4196340","4199620"," This is what he's saying, by the way, 700 years ago.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4199760","4205100"," He thinks that we're living in a time of great confusion, and we have to be gentle with people.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4205260","4206600"," We have to be understanding.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4206600","4209780"," We have to be compassionate imams.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4210400","4213520"," We have to establish the truth, which he does.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4213640","4220520"," We establish the truth, but we're not going to be rushing to takfir people or to boycott them and to say that they're this and that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4220520","4220620"," I don't.","Jake Brancatella"
"4220620","4220880"," I don't do that.","Jake Brancatella"
"4221020","4222520"," You takfir me, bro, right now!","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4222600","4225180"," You're takfiring me to this moment in time.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4225200","4228840"," Man, we can go back over my takfir of you.","Jake Brancatella"
"4228960","4231820"," We're going to spend a lot of time on Ibn Taymiyyah.","Jake Brancatella"
"4231920","4232800"," That's not the point.","Jake Brancatella"
"4233100","4241120"," The point is, the difference between somebody like Ibn Taymiyyah and these other scholars is in terms of their usool or their fundamentals.","Jake Brancatella"
"4241500","4259880"," They explicitly have deviant and kufri beliefs when it comes to their approach, their fundamentals, their usool, how they interpret scripture, where they get knowledge from, where they take knowledge from, and it leads to these deviant and kufri positions, like what al-Ghazali says in this passage.","Jake Brancatella"
"4260160","4272600"," He says, Allah does not mind if he forgives all disbelievers and punishes all believers, for this is not impossible within his essence, nor does it contradict any of his divine attributes.","Jake Brancatella"
"4272940","4278900"," This is because the concept of obligation, taklif, signifies his authority over his servants.","Jake Brancatella"
"4279060","4279640"," Listen to this.","Jake Brancatella"
"4279980","4291100"," In the realm of his divinity and majesty, disbelief and belief, meaning kufr and iman, as well as obedience and rebellion, hold equal standing.","Jake Brancatella"
"4291100","4294580"," Do you think that's a permissible position to hold?","Jake Brancatella"
"4294880","4300960"," That in the sight of Allah, kufr and belief, kufr and iman, are actually equal standing?","Jake Brancatella"
"4301700","4307400"," Before we continue, I think we'll have to shorten this session so that way we can make maghrib because of the projector issues.","Host"
"4307800","4309200"," So right now we're at 22 minutes.","Host"
"4309220","4310500"," If y'all wanted to continue to 30.","Host"
"4310980","4311960"," I think we'll make it.","Jake Brancatella"
"4312000","4312560"," We got time.","Jake Brancatella"
"4313220","4314040"," We'll catch it.","Jake Brancatella"
"4314540","4316320"," Well, you're traveling, so that's different for you.","Host"
"4316980","4320560"," If we went through the time, we would be exactly at isha time.","Host"
"4321680","4322080"," No, no, no.","Jake Brancatella"
"4322120","4324380"," I'm saying we can finish this period.","Jake Brancatella"
"4325620","4327140"," We've got like 15 minutes left, right?","Jake Brancatella"
"4327260","4329120"," Yeah, it's at 22 minutes, so you have like 18 minutes left.","Host"
"4330040","4331760"," You can just finish in 10 minutes.","Jake Brancatella"
"4331940","4332140"," Okay.","Host"
"4332220","4333880"," If you wanted to cut it down to 30 minutes, maybe we could.","Host"
"4334240","4334420"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"4336080","4336240"," Yeah.","Jake Brancatella"
"4336420","4346720"," So are you saying that this position of Ghazali, saying that kufr and iman hold equal standing in the sight of Allah, is this an acceptable view?","Jake Brancatella"
"4346720","4348960"," I have to see how he explains this.","Jake Brancatella"
"4349120","4350460"," You're just showing me a snippet.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4350760","4355740"," This is the kind of gotcha journalism like Piers Morgan does.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4355760","4356200"," How is this gotcha?","Jake Brancatella"
"4356840","4359080"," You take a statement.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4359760","4361060"," Oh, do you agree with that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4361160","4365280"," Oh, on this date, you said that we should kill all women.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4365880","4367020"," Do you stand by that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4367540","4370540"," That's the kind of game that you're playing.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4370640","4371260"," You're taking this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4371320","4372940"," I don't know what Ghazali means by this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4372980","4373940"," I don't know how he explains it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4373940","4375200"," I don't know his evidence for this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4375360","4376260"," How can I judge?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4376260","4377500"," How can I judge?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4377800","4380620"," And you claim, oh, the academic method.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4380740","4381640"," You have to be academic.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4382020","4382220"," Okay.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4382360","4383320"," Well, what is the explanation?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4383920","4387760"," See, this is the kind of intellectual charity that you have to give people.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4388340","4395980"," I don't believe that Ghazali is this crazy psycho or Razi is this crazy psycho who just wants to have these kufr beliefs.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4396220","4412820"," I think they are making a good faith effort to understand the Qur'an and Sunnah and their understanding of the Qur'an and Sunnah is so far beyond mine that for me to claim or to think that, oh, but they're so crazy that they're bungling this issue.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4413000","4414120"," They're making this huge error.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4414260","4416540"," I'm just going to sit back and laugh at it and call them deviant.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4416740","4419080"," What kind of mindset do you have to have for that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4419420","4432940"," Like, for example, if some genius that is miles above me in intellect and research and academia and has a certain position that sounds weird to me, sounds weird and bizarre to me, I don't say, ha, look at that idiot.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4432940","4434760"," Look at that R word.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4434900","4439060"," I say, hmm, I guess, I wonder what kind of explanation he has for that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4439260","4440840"," I wonder what evidence he has for that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4441000","4442340"," I need to look it up more.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4442440","4444020"," Maybe one day I can be at his level.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4444200","4448280"," Like, that's the kind of approach that an intellectually honest person has to these scholars.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4448540","4454840"," Yeah, but you are somebody who in the next segment is actually going to argue that Ibn Taymiyyah held kufr beliefs.","Jake Brancatella"
"4455400","4458260"," So why couldn't that also be possible for Ghazali?","Jake Brancatella"
"4459220","4464080"," With Ibn Taymiyyah, I don't want to do this exercise and investigate Ibn Taymiyyah's views.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4464280","4473040"," I'm only taking your method, and that's why this segment of the debate is first, so that you can show your standards for hammering scholars.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4473440","4476260"," You can show your standard for going ruthlessly against them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4476540","4482420"," And then in the next debate, when I use your method against Ibn Taymiyyah, you're going to be soft.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4482520","4483440"," You're going to make excuses.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4483620","4485580"," You're going to say, oh, well, what's the context of that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4485720","4488100"," Oh, let's look at what he actually means by that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4488140","4491820"," And you're going to give all these kinds of explanations to try to justify it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4491820","4497640"," And that contrast is what's going to show the audience that you're inconsistent.","Jake Brancatella"
"4497980","4498780"," No, it's not at all.","Jake Brancatella"
"4499080","4501160"," You keep trying to push it to that discussion.","Jake Brancatella"
"4501440","4502960"," We're going to get to that discussion.","Jake Brancatella"
"4503360","4508560"," But the Ash'ari and Maturidi views, when they say, for example, we heard from As-Sanusi earlier.","Jake Brancatella"
"4508680","4516740"," He literally said when listing the beliefs, some of which he says are kufr, he says that Allah's actions are for a purpose.","Jake Brancatella"
"4517520","4522240"," He's listing that as a false belief that is potentially kufr.","Jake Brancatella"
"4522520","4526500"," And that's the same reason which is directly connected to Al-Ghazali.","Jake Brancatella"
"4526860","4539900"," For Al-Ghazali, the Ash'aris literally believe that Allah, if he so chose, could have just as easily willed for kufr and shirk to be good instead of iman and obedience.","Jake Brancatella"
"4540600","4545420"," That's their belief because they don't believe that Allah does anything for any reason.","Jake Brancatella"
"4545500","4551540"," That's why he says, most of the lay people believe that Allah's actions are for a purpose.","Jake Brancatella"
"4552240","4564640"," Yeah, look, if Sanusi, if these Ash'aris, if Razi started waging war on the ummah, like they takfir, as you said, you claim that they're takfiring or they're saying everyone is upon kufr.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4564800","4568600"," If they said that and they started waging war like the Wahhabis did, they start attacking...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4569200","4570420"," Is that what Sanusi is saying right here?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4570620","4571360"," Did they go to war?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4571820","4572600"," Did they go to war?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4572720","4576400"," Did they make an F-tier tier list and say that...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4576400","4579740"," He wrote it in a book which is quoted today by people in college.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4579980","4585660"," I'm disassociating from this one and that one and we need to ally with the kufr against the Muslims.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4585900","4586700"," That's the Wahhabi belief.","Jake Brancatella"
"4586700","4587380"," I never said that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4587520","4588160"," I never said that.","Jake Brancatella"
"4588400","4596360"," My point to you is Sanusi is applying these beliefs to a majority of people.","Jake Brancatella"
"4596600","4599040"," Do you believe that Allah's actions are for a purpose?","Jake Brancatella"
"4600340","4604000"," Even off the top of my head, I can think of an explanation for this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4604240","4614300"," Do you think that Allah, like human purpose when humans act, generally it's guided by certain practical or pragmatic ends that they're pursuing.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4614620","4617660"," Like I reach for this water because I want to drink.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4617800","4618280"," I'm thirsty.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4618560","4621200"," I go to bed because I need to sleep.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4621300","4622320"," I feel the need to sleep.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4622500","4626840"," I have these needs and I pursue certain...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4626840","4634620"," When it says I have a purpose in doing this or that, it's because of those needs that I have or those kinds of practical purpose that I have.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4634620","4636480"," And Allah doesn't have a need for anything.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4636700","4643860"," So I can imagine that line of reasoning to deny the purposeful action of Allah in that way.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4643960","4646460"," Like you can give an easy ta'weel to understand this.","Jake Brancatella"
"4646600","4650440"," So in that sense, then kufr and iman could be equal in the sight of Allah.","Jake Brancatella"
"4650780","4662980"," He could throw the Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu wasalam and all the believers into the hellfire and put shaytan and the pharaoh and all the disbelievers into paradise and it would make no difference for Allah.","Jake Brancatella"
"4663140","4663680"," Do you believe that?","Jake Brancatella"
"4664860","4665340"," No.","Jake Brancatella"
"4665600","4667640"," But again, is this something so obvious?","Jake Brancatella"
"4668200","4669280"," Yeah, it is.","Jake Brancatella"
"4669440","4672280"," The way that I think about...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4672280","4678220"," Because I've studied these things to not your level, not going into this level of depth in these debates.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4678640","4682480"," But I'll tell you why I didn't pursue it even more than I did.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4682980","4691380"," Because I go and read a Salafi argument against the Ash'aris on one issue and I say, wow, okay, that's a really strong argument.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4691480","4693060"," I guess the Ash'aris are deviant.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4693320","4694280"," But I'm curious.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4694280","4696980"," I want to know what the other side has to say.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4697060","4698120"," What's their best argument?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4698380","4701840"," So I go to the Ash'aris and they give their argument and it's really good.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4702160","4704280"," And I say, wow, that's really good.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4705080","4708680"," I wonder what the Salafis have to say or the Ash'aris have to say in response to that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4708820","4711100"," So I go to the Ash'aris and they have a response.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4711380","4717060"," And then it just gets more and more sophisticated, more and more abstruse and abstract and complex.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4717320","4732280"," And then I reach a certain point and I just, this is so above my pay grade and I can see, I can see how two rational people who are pious, who are brilliant, way more intelligent than I am, can reasonably disagree on something.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4732620","4736960"," Like this is something that intellectually honest people recognize with each other.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4737260","4740120"," Like that's why, I think, why William Lane Craig was so successful.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4740300","4745560"," He went against atheists and got them to say that, well, it's reasonable to believe in God.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4745700","4746580"," Atheists had to concede.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4746680","4747500"," I guess it's reasonable.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4747620","4755200"," I don't believe it but I think that it's reasonable because, and we should also have the same kind of attitude towards these ulema.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4755420","4756820"," Okay, they might have erred.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4757180","4759340"," They might have made maybe even a major mistake.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4759580","4765500"," But it's still, I can see how a tet wheel can lead down a certain path to arrive at that conclusion.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4766060","4771120"," Yeah, but these beliefs, as I said, are matters of fundamentals in the deen.","Jake Brancatella"
"4771420","4778280"," They're matters of how scripture is even interpreted with Arazi, Teftazani, and the quotes I mentioned earlier.","Jake Brancatella"
"4778700","4787740"," Like, for example, people make a big to-do about Yadullah and the salafis and asharis go back and forth about the hand of Allah and what is it and what the meaning is.","Jake Brancatella"
"4788040","4797020"," But there are things that are even more important and more fundamental, which is, for example, Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la doing different things at different times.","Jake Brancatella"
"4797420","4798960"," Does He act in succession?","Jake Brancatella"
"4799400","4803840"," Does He create, did He create your mother before He created you?","Jake Brancatella"
"4804520","4813880"," I mean, these are things that are all throughout the Qur'an and Sunnah where Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la appears to be doing different things at different times.","Jake Brancatella"
"4814040","4816020"," That's the apparent meaning of the text.","Jake Brancatella"
"4816160","4817220"," Do you accept that?","Jake Brancatella"
"4817740","4817940"," No.","Jake Brancatella"
"4818060","4824360"," If it were so fundamental like the createdness or uncreatedness of the Qur'an, it would be mentioned explicitly.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4824800","4831160"," The actual doctrine would be mentioned explicitly or at least, at the very least, the sahaba would be talking about it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4831400","4832640"," But there's no evidence of this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4832640","4833800"," It's all throughout the Qur'an.","Jake Brancatella"
"4834040","4840800"," And Ibn Hanbal, the createdness of the Qur'an No, what I just mentioned in terms of Allah doing different things at different times.","Jake Brancatella"
"4840800","4843100"," Do you believe that He does different things at different times?","Jake Brancatella"
"4845920","4847340"," You know, what is time?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4847480","4848040"," I would have to say.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4848160","4849120"," That's my response to that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4849220","4849980"," What is time?","Jake Brancatella"
"4850420","4852480"," What is our metaphysics of time?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4852980","4855920"," Do you believe that Allah has already judged creation?","Jake Brancatella"
"4857520","4859980"," Has judgment day already happened for Allah?","Jake Brancatella"
"4860240","4860980"," Has He already done it?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4861000","4863400"," I can see good arguments for both sides, yeah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4863720","4864020"," Really?","Jake Brancatella"
"4864600","4867700"," So that's an acceptable view to believe.","Jake Brancatella"
"4867700","4868860"," I don't know if it's acceptable.","Jake Brancatella"
"4869020","4869400"," I don't know.","Jake Brancatella"
"4869400","4870460"," I have to research it.","Jake Brancatella"
"4870460","4870760"," So like this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4870940","4871780"," Let me give an example.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4872540","4873380"," I plead the fifth.","Jake Brancatella"
"4873680","4874500"," I've got to research it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4874520","4876680"," Allah says in the Qur'an that He created.","Jake Brancatella"
"4876680","4877120"," We've got to pray.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4877780","4878640"," This is the last point.","Jake Brancatella"
"4878740","4883140"," Allah says that He created jinn before He created mankind.","Jake Brancatella"
"4883800","4886820"," Did He actually create the jinn before He created mankind?","Jake Brancatella"
"4888180","4888360"," Yeah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4888620","4890520"," In the creation where time exists, yeah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4891100","4892560"," Yeah, but His action.","Jake Brancatella"
"4893000","4895060"," Did He do different actions at different times?","Jake Brancatella"
"4895260","4898940"," Did He act and create the jinn and then act again and create mankind?","Jake Brancatella"
"4898940","4902580"," I'll answer that if you explain what time is.","Jake Brancatella"
"4903100","4913740"," If you explain to me time, the metaphysical concept of time that no philosopher has been able to understand and explain and theorize in a convincing way.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4913820","4918420"," If you can do that for me by the end of this debate, then I'll give you an answer to that question.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4918500","4918660"," Okay.","Host"
"4918880","4919120"," Inshallah.","Jake Brancatella"
"4919320","4919840"," You won't answer.","Jake Brancatella"
"4919940","4920080"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"4920160","4920640"," Thank you.","Jake Brancatella"
"4921320","4921800"," Inshallah.","Host"
"4921920","4922960"," Speaking of time.","Host"
"4924620","4926120"," We have an intermission.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4926720","4927820"," We can just pause it, yeah.","Jake Brancatella"
"4927820","4929300"," Did you want to do the closing statement?","Host"
"4929400","4930360"," No, we could just pause it.","Jake Brancatella"
"4930560","4931120"," Closing statements after?","Jake Brancatella"
"4931480","4932620"," Because that's going to take 10 minutes.","Jake Brancatella"
"4932760","4933740"," We'll just do that after.","Jake Brancatella"
"4934040","4934220"," Okay.","Host"
"4934400","4936380"," Yeah, intermission and then concluding statement.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"4936900","4937220"," Inshallah.","Host"
"4937340","4938100"," We'll do that then.","Host"
"5820060","5820580"," Assalamu alaikum.","Host"
"5820700","5821200"," Welcome back.","Host"
"5822300","5826320"," We'll conclude this session with the closing statements starting with Brother Pankatella.","Host"
"5828380","5828780"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"5828940","5829340"," Bismillah.","Jake Brancatella"
"5829560","5830240"," So, yeah.","Jake Brancatella"
"5830300","5835800"," We saw in this debate and this is, you know, just the reality, I think, of what happened.","Jake Brancatella"
"5835800","5842800"," The debate is supposed to be on whether or not the Ash'ari and Maturidi creeds are deviant.","Jake Brancatella"
"5843340","5850220"," I think Daniel doesn't necessarily think they're deviant because he doesn't know enough about them.","Jake Brancatella"
"5850740","5857740"," When I asked him regarding the Ash'ari and Maturidi position on the Arabic Qur'an, they explicitly say this is makhluq.","Jake Brancatella"
"5857940","5862180"," And I'm going to actually go into more detail on that in the next debate.","Jake Brancatella"
"5862280","5868500"," So, make sure you guys stay tuned for that because we have one last section of the debate coming after these five minutes.","Jake Brancatella"
"5869320","5878260"," So, I genuinely believe that Daniel doesn't know enough about this topic in order to take a position one way or another.","Jake Brancatella"
"5878520","5879940"," I'm not saying he has to agree with me.","Jake Brancatella"
"5880300","5883140"," I think if he, you know, does...","Jake Brancatella"
"5883140","5889160"," Anyone who does serious study on this, I think, should come to the right conclusion that the Ash'ari and Maturidi creeds are deviant.","Jake Brancatella"
"5889380","5915380"," And the difference between the creeds and the individual who holds them is that many of these Ash'ari scholars in their fundamentals, in usul, in al-Razi's explanation of taking reason over revelation when they contradict, when Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah and the mainstream Athari position, is that no, that the Qur'an and Sunnah can never contradict sound reason.","Jake Brancatella"
"5915720","5924120"," But they believe that it can and in the context that when it does, they have to do ta'wil and interpret the apparent meaning of the text differently.","Jake Brancatella"
"5924400","5932780"," That's why they explicitly say that the zahir of the Qur'an at Taftazani, he said this in the quote earlier, is actually kufr.","Jake Brancatella"
"5933420","5952440"," And to explain that, they say, well, the zahir of the Qur'an is kufr, and that's why the majority of the lay people have these kufri beliefs, like believing that Allah is above the throne or that he speaks sometimes and sometimes he's silent, like when he spoke to Musa alayhis salaam or that he acts for a purpose and does different things at different times.","Jake Brancatella"
"5953360","5965220"," These beliefs are problematic for them, but they admit that they're the zahir or apparent meaning of the Qur'an, but they say that we have to reinterpret them in light of our so-called rational principles.","Jake Brancatella"
"5965380","5969260"," But in reality, what they are, are pseudo-rational principles.","Jake Brancatella"
"5969720","5971120"," They're pseudo-aqli principles.","Jake Brancatella"
"5971560","5974240"," They're not principles that come from a sound fitrah.","Jake Brancatella"
"5974560","5977600"," They're not principles that come from sound reason.","Jake Brancatella"
"5978020","5983900"," They're principles that come from outside sources, from the Greeks and pagan sources.","Jake Brancatella"
"5984320","5986480"," They're not genuine aqli principles.","Jake Brancatella"
"5987400","5988800"," Now, because of that,","Jake Brancatella"
"5988900","5990700"," because of their foundational","Jake Brancatella"
"5990700","5991790"," problematic positions","Jake Brancatella"
"5992340","5993500"," related to usul,","Jake Brancatella"
"5993900","5995720"," or foundations and fundamentals,","Jake Brancatella"
"5996260","5998100"," it leads to them, therefore,","Jake Brancatella"
"5998380","6000360"," embracing many false positions,","Jake Brancatella"
"6000740","6002280"," like kufr and iman,","Jake Brancatella"
"6002400","6003740"," being equal in the sight of Allah,","Jake Brancatella"
"6004020","6005000"," Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala","Jake Brancatella"
"6005000","6006980"," not acting for any reason at all,","Jake Brancatella"
"6007260","6008600"," him not doing different things","Jake Brancatella"
"6008600","6009440"," at different times,","Jake Brancatella"
"6009440","6011420"," the Arabic Quran being created","Jake Brancatella"
"6011420","6012300"," or makhluq,","Jake Brancatella"
"6013080","6014480"," Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala","Jake Brancatella"
"6014480","6016740"," not being above the throne or above,","Jake Brancatella"
"6016940","6018620"," all of these different positions","Jake Brancatella"
"6018620","6019440"," that they have,","Jake Brancatella"
"6019800","6020700"," which in one way or another","Jake Brancatella"
"6020700","6022800"," are bid'ah or kufr or both,","Jake Brancatella"
"6023220","6024980"," is that it's because","Jake Brancatella"
"6024980","6026560"," of their foundations.","Jake Brancatella"
"6026960","6035880"," You have to understand, it's because of their toolkit that they use, and that what makes them wind up having these deviant or kufri beliefs.","Jake Brancatella"
"6036100","6058850"," But Daniel, by his own admission, I don't think knows enough about the topic, he doesn't even know that the mainstream, fundamental position of the Ash'aris and Maturidis is that the Arabic Quran is makhluq, the Quran that we all know that we recite, that is preserved in our chests and in our texts, is actually a created text.","Jake Brancatella"
"6059560","6064840"," They don't believe that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala ever spoke it, he doesn't actually speak, according to the Ash'aris.","Jake Brancatella"
"6065240","6072280"," According to the Ash'aris, all of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala actions are actually created, they're makhluq, they're things that exist in creation.","Jake Brancatella"
"6073400","6091560"," So there are so many fundamental problems with the Ash'ari and Maturidi creeds, they are deviant, and hey, don't take it personally, because they think my creed is deviant, they think that the creed of the classical Hanabilah is deviant.","Jake Brancatella"
"6093300","6108620"," They state this openly, they call us Hashawiya, they say that we are Mujassima, they say that we are guilty of kufr with some of the beliefs that we hold, which al-Sanusi attributes to the lay people as well.","Jake Brancatella"
"6108860","6122440"," The beliefs that he attributes to the lay people are many of the same beliefs that are held by Ahl al-Hadith, classical Hanabilah, traditional Atharis, and yet he says that some of those beliefs are kufr.","Jake Brancatella"
"6122440","6130240"," So it is not an anomaly, it is not something that the Ahl al-Hadith are just waging war against the Ash'aris and Maturidis.","Jake Brancatella"
"6130840","6131900"," It was reciprocated.","Jake Brancatella"
"6132540","6140200"," We believe that each other are fundamentally wrong in our creeds, and that's why each group respectively holds that they're deviant.","Jake Brancatella"
"6140520","6152920"," That doesn't mean that we cannot unite with them in any respect at all, that doesn't mean that we believe that anyone who says they're an Ash'ari or Maturidi is necessarily a deviant or a kafir.","Jake Brancatella"
"6153160","6155560"," Daniel said, I takfir all Ash'aris and Maturidis.","Jake Brancatella"
"6155760","6157140"," That's a lie from the pit of hell.","Jake Brancatella"
"6157520","6158640"," That's not true at all.","Jake Brancatella"
"6158820","6160900"," He's referring to a tweet","Jake Brancatella"
"6160900","6161560"," that I made","Jake Brancatella"
"6161560","6163040"," in which I said","Jake Brancatella"
"6163040","6164740"," that their beliefs,","Jake Brancatella"
"6164940","6165820"," some of which","Jake Brancatella"
"6165820","6167740"," rise to the level of kufr,","Jake Brancatella"
"6167760","6169300"," where I was actually quoting","Jake Brancatella"
"6169300","6171560"," Shaykh Sultan al-Umaydi,","Jake Brancatella"
"6172180","6174420"," who is, by some salafis,","Jake Brancatella"
"6174500","6175840"," is actually accused of irja","Jake Brancatella"
"6175840","6177120"," and being too soft","Jake Brancatella"
"6177120","6178980"," on the Ash'aris and Maturidis,","Jake Brancatella"
"6179420","6180600"," but he himself admits","Jake Brancatella"
"6180600","6181400"," that some beliefs,","Jake Brancatella"
"6181400","6183600"," like their idea of the creation","Jake Brancatella"
"6183600","6185500"," of the Qur'an being makhluq","Jake Brancatella"
"6185500","6185960"," or created,","Jake Brancatella"
"6186280","6187920"," is a kufri belief","Jake Brancatella"
"6187920","6190000"," and other beliefs that they hold.","Jake Brancatella"
"6190180","6204600"," And in light of that, because they have kufri beliefs, mainstream kufri beliefs, that once iqamat al-hajjah is done upon them, then the proof has been established upon the person and they're holding kufri beliefs and we know what the result is.","Jake Brancatella"
"6204780","6205780"," That's what I said.","Jake Brancatella"
"6206200","6211180"," But most throughout the world are not Ash'ari and Maturidis, according to their own scholars.","Jake Brancatella"
"6211520","6212800"," Thank you very much for listening.","Jake Brancatella"
"6213020","6214060"," Tune in to the next debate.","Jake Brancatella"
"6218080","6218380"," Insha'Allah.","Host"
"6218500","6221920"," Next, we can move to Daniel's closing statement.","Host"
"6223260","6224160"," Ready when you are.","Host"
"6225480","6225920"," Yes.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6226240","6231600"," So, I'll just review what I mentioned in the actual opening statement.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6231740","6233140"," I think they're still highly relevant.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6233300","6234740"," The errors of the Wahhabis.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6234820","6238780"," The first error is that they reject or they minimize the concept of jama'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6239180","6246540"," Because if you have the concept of ahlus sunnah wal jama'ah, what's the significance of the addition of jama'ah?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6246940","6249280"," Like, what does that actually signify?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6249400","6251020"," What's important about the jama'ah?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6251540","6258740"," If it's just ahlus sunnah, okay, your understanding of what the sunnah is, you just stick to that and that's the ummah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6259240","6260780"," You know, everyone is upon the sunnah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6261560","6264700"," But it would be redundant if that's just what jama'ah meant.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6265240","6275500"," Rather, jama'ah means that despite differences, despite sometimes bitter differences, that you come together, you cling together as one ummah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6275980","6277480"," That is the concept of jama'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6277600","6281560"," And that's what distinguishes ahlus sunnah from the khawarij.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6281900","6288360"," It's what distinguishes ahlus sunnah from the mu'tazila, actually from the shia.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6289620","6292440"," That's what makes us ahlus sunnah wal jama'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6292540","6303440"," That we can have these differences when it comes to aqidah, when it comes to fiqh, when it comes to hadith, and we can still be one ummah, we can be one jama'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6304000","6308600"," But unfortunately the wahhabis, they follow the khawarij in minimizing this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6308700","6315960"," They don't even seem to have any kind of coherent concept of jama'ah because they restrict it to their small tiny fringe.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6317120","6322360"," The second error, they selectively read Islamic history to emphasize incidents of conflict.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6322700","6323720"," And this is what we see.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6323720","6337800"," We can go and look at the great scholars of the deen and even when they have contradictory positions and they're maybe even engaged in a bitter theological debate, they're still able to come together.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6337980","6345480"," They're still able to respect each other and treat each other with that level of respect as a Muslim brother standing together.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6345820","6351220"," You can't do that as a wahhabi because wahhabis will boycott you.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6351280","6355740"," If you even associate with the other side, they will boycott you, they will denounce you.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6355840","6364040"," They say you're actually a grifter because you haven't denounced or you haven't critiqued ahlul bid'ah to the extent that I deem satisfactory.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6364580","6370720"," So this kind of conflict, perpetual civil war, this is a disaster.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6370940","6378260"," And I think people have seen that from wahhabis including Jake when they go out and they want to aqidah check.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6378560","6381160"," They want to accuse people of kufr and deviance.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6381160","6383020"," And what do you believe about Allah's yad?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6383100","6385080"," What do you believe about istawa' ala'l arsh?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6385140","6388280"," What do you believe about the createdness of the Quran?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6389060","6389560"," Why?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6389800","6391600"," Why do this?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6391820","6394760"," Why create these kinds of conflicts?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6395400","6398400"," It really buggers belief.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6399400","6402980"," And then selectively reading history, yeah, there were periods of fitan.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6403760","6411240"," From the time of the sahaba, you had the fitan that affected ahlul hadith versus the mu'tazila versus the jami'ah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6411780","6413200"," Yeah, these are periods of fitan.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6413440","6421300"," We don't selectively look at the statements of takfir and the polemical representations of the other camp from that period.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6421440","6427160"," If we do that, we're going to think that being part of the Muslim ummah means to be constantly in a period of fitna.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6427860","6430820"," You have to look at other periods and other periods of the ummah's history.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6431240","6433720"," There was tolerance despite ihtilaf.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6433880","6435640"," There was mutual respect.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6435900","6436940"," There was cooperation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6436940","6443120"," And that's what someone like al-Ghazali or Ibn Taymiyyah, they recognized.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6443480","6451780"," And they tried to codify that and they made very strong statements justifying that and saying that that's actually the position of the salaf.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6451920","6456180"," The position of the salaf is to cooperate despite the fitan that arose.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6457020","6461780"," Third era of the wahabis speaking on secondary matters of aqidah where there is no need.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6461880","6463160"," I think I established that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6463260","6468920"," There's nowhere in the Quran or the sunnah that talks about these issues that Jake brought up.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6469240","6469840"," Go ahead.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6470440","6472220"," People who are watching are Muslims.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6472700","6474800"," They have read the Quran their entire lives.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6475480","6481520"," And I only heard about the createdness of the Quran issue when I was an undergrad.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6481780","6485060"," And that's because I was taking academic classes in Islam.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6485600","6488640"," And I was like, what does this even mean?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6488820","6490380"," What does this question even mean?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6490700","6492580"," And that's the vast majority of people.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6492700","6496560"," But you're trying to say that this is required to study this and to have the right position.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6496660","6501740"," Otherwise, you're not going to be accepted by Allah on Yawm al-Qiyamah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6501860","6504260"," This is just not very plausible.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6505100","6511620"," And also the point that when you get into these secondary and tertiary topics, people fall into blasphemy.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6511980","6516100"," Like people fall into kufr inadvertently because they're not experts in the Arabic language.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6516240","6520320"," Because they're not experts in the usool of the deen.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6520580","6521560"," Even if they want to be.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6521660","6523500"," Even if we assume that your usool is correct.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6523980","6527880"," The vast majority of people including yourself, frankly, are not going to be experts in that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6527980","6529960"," And they're going to fall into major blunders.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6530100","6530980"," This is a disaster.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6531400","6532900"," This is a terrible disaster.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6533060","6533500"," It's a fitna.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6534640","6539160"," And then the fifth error of using to acknowledge context and determining the limits of orthodoxy.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6539280","6540500"," This is Ibn Taymiyyah's approach.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6541020","6552140"," Ibn Taymiyyah says that, look, earlier in the history of the Ummah with the Salaf, if you were a jahmi, that is a more serious error than if you're literally a jahmi in his time.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6552580","6555300"," It's more serious because at that time they had more knowledge.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6555440","6563980"," So he had this very sophisticated relational understanding of who is considered part of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah and who is not.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6564320","6568200"," And we know that as time goes on, knowledge is only decreasing and decreasing.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6568600","6571400"," And we are really at the bottom of the barrel at this point.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6571400","6572380"," At this point in history.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6572460","6575340"," Our distance from the Prophet and the Salaf.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6575820","6582260"," That we really can't be doing this kind of aqeedah checking and causing this civil war and fitna at this time.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6583080","6593640"," We really need to have a much more tolerant, accepting, respectful approach to all Ahlus Sunnah which is ash'ari, ma turidi, and athari.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6599540","6607060"," We can roll into the next debate inshallah on who is the true athari.","Host"
"6607660","6610780"," Daniel Haqiqa Jew or Ibn Taymiyyah?","Host"
"6614200","6616320"," Pressing topic on the minds of all the Muslims.","Host"
"6618820","6619600"," What was that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6621040","6621420"," No, no.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6623920","6624440"," Okay.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6624880","6625480"," We're good?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6630400","6633700"," Who is the true or the real athari?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6634040","6637040"," Is it Ibn Taymiyyah or is it Daniel Haqiqa Jew?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6637280","6642420"," In determining who is or is not truly an athari, we must first answer this basic question.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6642520","6652380"," Can someone accurately be described as an athari while rejecting positions that are not only the consensus within the athari school but consensus among Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah more generally?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6652720","6654420"," My answer to this question is yes.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6654560","6664360"," In fact, as mentioned in the previous section of the debate, a scholar can even hold a mistaken position that amounts to kufr and still be respected imam of Ahlus Sunnah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6665060","6671740"," When it comes to Ibn Taymiyyah, he held several positions that were rejected as kufr by major scholars of Ahlus Sunnah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6672000","6679620"," And these positions were so controversial that even major Wahhabi figures explicitly criticized Ibn Taymiyyah for them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6680320","6681900"," I'll present these views now.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6682780","6686980"," First, it is permissible to request money and medicine from jinn.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6687660","6694580"," Wahhabis say that if you request aid from other than Allah, that is clear-cut shirk and whoever does it is a mushrik kafir.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6694820","6696700"," But what about seeking aid from jinn?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6697360","6699540"," Wahhabis themselves seem to be split on this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6699640","6708960"," According to a Twitter poll I did, 58% of respondents took the position of Ibn Abdul Wahhab and Ibn Baz who said that requesting aid from the jinn is shirk in all cases.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6709640","6718280"," You can pause the screen and read these quotes from Ibn Abdul Wahhab and Ibn Baz yourself where they say very definitively that requesting aid from the jinn is shirk akbar.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6719140","6720520"," Here's that Ibn Baz quote.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6721100","6725200"," Well, then that means that Ibn Taymiyyah advocated for shirk akbar.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6725460","6727040"," That's the conclusion that we have to reach.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6727820","6732140"," Ibn Taymiyyah said, the point here is that the jinn interact with humans in various ways.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6732280","6733040"," Whoever among the humans","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6733040","6733940"," commands the jinn","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6733940","6735120"," with what Allah and His Messenger","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6735120","6735720"," Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6735720","6736220"," have commanded,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6736360","6737500"," namely to worship Allah alone","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6737500","6738220"," and obey His Prophet","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6738220","6739760"," and likewise commands humans","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6739760","6740440"," to do the same,","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6740700","6741400"," then such a person","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6741400","6742940"," is among the best of the awliya","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6742940","6744260"," of Allah Most High","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6744260","6746020"," and whoever uses the jinn","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6746020","6747480"," in matters that are permitted to him","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6747480","6748420"," then he is like one","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6748420","6749280"," who uses humans","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6749280","6750240"," in matters that are permitted.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6750720","6757020"," This is like commanding them with what is obligatory upon them, forbidding them from what is forbidden to them and employing them in permitted things.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6757340","6760600"," Such a person is in the position of a king who does likewise.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6761020","6764640"," So according to Ibn Taymiyyah, there is no problem in calling the jinn with requests.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6765060","6771960"," This goes directly contrary to what Ibn Abdul Wahab and Ibn Basay who categorically consider any request from the jinn to be major shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6772700","6774420"," Now look at what else Ibn Taymiyyah says.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6774600","6785140"," Among them are those who employ the jinn in permissible matters such as retrieving one's property or indicating the location of wealth that has no protected meaning legally entitled owner or repelling someone who harms him and the like.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6785480","6788400"," This is like humans helping one another in such matters.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6788860","6799460"," So according to Ibn Taymiyyah, you can call on the jinn for any permissible matter like bringing you buried treasure or helping you find something that you've lost or protecting you from the harm of an enemy army, for example.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6799840","6802600"," This is all allowed according to Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6802860","6808900"," Meanwhile, Ibn Abdul Wahab says that anything like this is clear cut shirk and whoever does it is an apostate that should be killed.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6809280","6814280"," Ibn Basay says the same thing as do many other contemporary scholars including al-Albani by the way.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6814580","6827320"," And what's interesting is al-Albani explicitly links the impermissibility of requesting aid from jinn to the fact that the jinn are from the ghayb, they're unseen which is what makes them different from requesting aid from humans.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6827900","6832700"," So the question is, why can't Wahabis be consistent and declare Ibn Taymiyyah to be a mushrik?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6834020","6839380"," The second point, Ibn Taymiyyah accused the Prophet ﷺ of mistakenly falling into shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6840200","6852300"," Some early Islamic texts report a particular event from the Prophet's ﷺ life known as the story of the cranes, قِسَةَ الْغَرَنِيخِ قِسَةَ الْغَرَنِيخِ In English, this is often referred to as the satanic verses incident.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6852960","6854560"," The story can be summarized briefly.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6854740","6862500"," In Mecca, the Prophet ﷺ was preaching to the mushrik Quraysh reciting verses that criticized their gods al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6862980","6870240"," Specifically, he recited surah an-Najm verses 19 through 20 have you not, have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza and the third Manat.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6870740","6879440"," According to this story, Satan then interfered causing the Prophet ﷺ to utter additional verses praising these pagan gods and inviting worship of them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6879740","6885520"," These satanic verses read, indeed they are like high cranes, their intercession with Allah is hoped for.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6886140","6892920"," The Prophet ﷺ reportedly believed these were from Allah and the Quraysh were pleased as it seemed to validate their polytheism.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6893320","6897160"," Shortly afterward, the angel Jibreel ﷺ came and revealed the truth.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6897420","6899640"," The verses were from Shaitan, not Allah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6899940","6902320"," The Prophet ﷺ rejected them immediately.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6902720","6911980"," In short, these reports claim the Prophet ﷺ was briefly deceived by Satan momentarily uttering something resembling shirk but he corrected it with divine guidance.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6912400","6917380"," Many scholars have rejected reports of these satanic verses as inauthentic with weak chains of transmission.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6917700","6920180"," Over time, opposition to these reports only grew.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6920580","6924540"," Major scholars even suggested that anyone who believes these reports falls into kufr.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6925000","6934100"," For example, Qadi Iyad says that affirming such claims directly contradicts what is established by decisive scriptural proofs and the consensus of the Ummah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6934880","6940680"," Fakhruddin Ar-Razi says that whoever affirms the story of the cranes has actually fallen into kufr.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6941340","6950060"," Nevertheless, Ibn Taymiyyah says that the story is true and he claims that the early generations of Muslims accepted this story and only the later generations rejected it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6950680","6954940"," Notably, Wahhabi scholars also reject reports on the story of the cranes.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6955100","6962120"," In his muqtasar, Sirat al-Rasul, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab takes the view that some parts of the report are true.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6962740","6966980"," Thus, the Prophet ﷺ was indeed reading Surat al-Najm before the Quraysh.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6967080","6970800"," However, the Prophet ﷺ never uttered the satanic verses.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6971040","6977460"," Rather, Satan somehow caused the Quraysh to hear them even though they were not actually uttered by the Prophet ﷺ.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6978240","6981140"," Ibn Baz goes a step further in distancing himself from the story.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6981300","6986140"," Contrary to Ibn Taymiyyah, he claims that there is no reliable and authentic report confirming the story.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6986860","6989100"," Here is a summary of their positions.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6990260","6996220"," Now, the next point, the material world is eternal and has always existed alongside Allah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"6996640","7004660"," One of the most famous debates in Islamic intellectual history concerns whether the material universe is eternal or whether it was created out of nothing by Allah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7005220","7010340"," Prior to Islam, Greek philosophers claimed that the material universe is eternal, it has always existed.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7010760","7016220"," According to this view, if God creates anything, He creates it out of matter that has existed forever into the past.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7016780","7019240"," Generally, ulama strongly reject this view.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7019340","7021300"," They hold that the only eternal being is Allah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7021840","7024740"," He created all things including basic matter out of nothing.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7025020","7029380"," Admittedly, philosophers like Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd agree with the Greek philosophical view.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7029760","7037540"," However, ulama fiercely oppose them and declare the idea of an eternal universe to be a type of kufr that takes one out of Islam.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7038120","7040000"," Ghazali is famous for this opinion.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7040240","7044660"," In Tahafut al-Falasifah, Qadi Iyad also says that this belief is kufr.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7045140","7052980"," Ibn Hazm says that Muslim scholars have a consensus, ijma' that the belief in the eternal universe makes one a kafir.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7053540","7060300"," What's so scandalous about the Greek philosophical view from the perspective of these scholars is that eternality is a divine attribute.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7060480","7063200"," So to apply that to other than Allah is highly problematic.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7063840","7068220"," By contrast, Ibn Taymiyyah consciously and very explicitly challenges this consensus.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7068620","7074420"," He holds that it's permissible to believe that the universe is eternal and that Allah did not create it out of nothing.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7074720","7080120"," He suggests that it's only permissible to believe this but it should be believed because it's correct.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7080120","7095540"," Ibn Taymiyyah writes in Allah's revelation there's nothing stating that his creating the heavens and the earth and what lies between them in six days negates the existence of some created thing before them nor does it negate that he may have created them from a preexistent substance.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7096160","7101240"," In his other writings, Ibn Taymiyyah repeatedly offers philosophical arguments to justify his view.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7101320","7107320"," For example, he says that for something to be created from nothing resembles Allah because Allah has no source from which he came.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7107640","7114720"," Therefore, it's actually more appropriate to believe that unlike Allah, the material world was created from a preexisting source of material.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7115440","7120220"," Ibn Taymiyyah develops a philosophical theory to justify the universe's eternal coexistence with Allah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7120460","7125980"," He argues that Allah has always existed and is perpetually creating so things have always existed alongside him.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7126320","7131520"," He calls this concept حوادث لا أولاها meaning non-eternal things with no first thing.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7132200","7145280"," While any specific non-eternal thing like the sun or moon has a temporal beginning, there has always been a succession of non-eternal things created from prior non-eternal things.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7145860","7148660"," Ibn Taymiyyah's theory has been strongly criticized by ulama.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7148800","7155020"," For example, the famous muhaddith Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani says that this is a reprehensible view of Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7155720","7166420"," The contemporary Salafi scholar al-Albani also harshly criticizes Ibn Taymiyyah and says hadith invalidate his whole theory like the hadith that the first thing Allah has created was the pen.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7166420","7175020"," Al-Albani then further states that Ibn Taymiyyah's theory is unacceptable and it resembles philosophy and kalam which should be avoided.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7176080","7182460"," So al-Albani notes that Ibn Taymiyyah's novel theory is something that contradicts the sunnah and it resembles philosophy and kalam.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7182760","7184640"," Is this the athari manhaj?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7184960","7195600"," If the athari aqeedah can accommodate Ibn Taymiyyah's speculation speculating new doctrines that have no basis in the Quran and sunnah about how Allah creates, then that's actually quite shocking.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7197120","7201140"," Next view, it's possible for you to believe that hell is not eternal.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7201400","7207500"," Perhaps the most controversial position of Ibn Taymiyyah is that hell is not eternal or that at least it's permissible to have that belief.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7208000","7212820"," In his earlier writings Ibn Taymiyyah adopts the standard viewpoint that hell is eternal.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7213000","7218720"," However, he challenges his view in his later writings including the last work he ever wrote.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7219080","7221980"," He makes it clear that it's only permissible to believe this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7222360","7228060"," He makes it clear that it's not only permissible to believe this but that there is strong evidence for such a view.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7228640","7236020"," In multiple places he argues that eternal hell conflicts with divine wisdom which is reason to reject eternal hell.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7236600","7241320"," Wahhabis often deny these basic historical facts so it's worth reviewing some basic academic scholarship.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7241860","7245580"," One relevant book is Farid Suleiman's Ibn Taymiyyah and the Attributes of God.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7245940","7256280"," In his book Suleiman notes that while Ibn Taymiyyah tries to cite scriptural evidence for his view he appears to interpret it through his own conception of God's justice rather than letting the evidence itself guide his reasoning.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7256740","7265100"," Another relevant work is John Hoover's Islamic Universalism Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah's Salafi deliberations on the duration of hellfire.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7265640","7272940"," Here Hoover states quote Ibn Taymiyyah breaks with the classical Sunni consensus that the fire is eternal by appealing to diversity amongst the Salaf.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7273820","7280760"," Ibn Taymiyyah's views on this immediately sparked controversy and were denounced as kufr by his contemporary Taqiyyadin al-Subqi.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7281280","7293320"," Other scholars of the time also denounced Ibn Taymiyyah including Alaa al-Din al-Bukhari and also Taqiyyadin al-Hisni who says that Ibn Taymiyyah's position directly contradicts numerous ayat of the Quran.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7294080","7299320"," Even scholars respected by Wahhabis acknowledge the nature of Ibn Taymiyyah's views on this topic.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7299760","7306280"," For example al-Albani acknowledges that Ibn Taymiyyah rejects traditional Muslim views on the eternality of the hellfire.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7306800","7319780"," al-Albani goes even further in saying quote Is this not among the greatest proofs of Ibn Taymiyyah's error and how far he and those who followed him strayed from what is correct in this grave matter.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7320600","7326320"," And then al-Albani also speculates that Ibn Taymiyyah may have been led into this mistake through the influence of Ibn Arabi.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7327100","7334540"," Another scholar who Wahhabis respect Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wadi also acknowledged that Ibn Taymiyyah had this view and called it an error.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7334900","7340800"," In commenting on Ibn Taymiyyah he also articulates a general rule that I think is actually excellent.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7341080","7341880"," It's beautiful.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7342320","7350580"," He says when a scholar makes a mistake while also possessing immense virtues his errors are overshadowed by his many merits.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7351000","7353040"," No scholar is immune from mistakes.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7353380","7355600"," Every great scholar has had errors.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7356600","7359080"," Here is the summarizing chart on this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7359720","7363080"," So my conclusion I want the Wahhabis to show consistency.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7363580","7373600"," Why should Ibn Taymiyyah be considered a Sunni let alone an Athari when he defended multiple views considered either by Ijma'a or by Jumhur to be Kufr?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7374260","7386680"," And when we look at the methodology of Ibn Taymiyyah using that he used to arrive at some of these views they were based on philosophical and speculative reasoning that sometimes were clearly contradictory to the Quran and Sunnah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7386900","7393340"," And if you don't believe Daniel believe Al-Albani believe other Wahhabi scholars who point this out.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7394340","7397760"," So either the Wahhabi is faced with two choices.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7398020","7419460"," Either he has to play games and deny that these views amount to Kufr or he has to bite the bullet and say yes Ibn Taymiyyah held Kufri views but he's excused for some reason or another at which point I'll have to ask why does Ibn Taymiyyah get a get out of jail free card but the other schools of Aqeedah like the Ash'aris and the Maturidis don't?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7426160","7426980"," I think it's good.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"7427520","7427740"," Okay.","Host"
"7429000","7432590"," Insha'Allah we can move to Sheikh's opening statements.","Host"
"7493060","7496440"," Who is the true or real Athari?","Jake Brancatella"
"7496740","7499440"," Ibn Taymiyyah or Daniel Haqiqatu?","Jake Brancatella"
"7500160","7506100"," I mean the title is honestly kind of funny just by accepting this debate I think Daniel has lost.","Jake Brancatella"
"7506760","7509220"," Like I mean how serious can we be?","Jake Brancatella"
"7509380","7513800"," I mean Daniel versus Ibn Taymiyyah is this guy really serious?","Jake Brancatella"
"7514020","7523400"," And if you notice for the most part and I think pretty much the entire thing he spent time actually just criticizing Ibn Taymiyyah.","Jake Brancatella"
"7523800","7530020"," He didn't establish why anyone should think that Daniel Haqiqatu is a real Athari which I thought we would see.","Jake Brancatella"
"7530020","7532020"," I mean I guess he doesn't have much evidence.","Jake Brancatella"
"7532460","7543660"," Now Daniel's Aqidah these are some quotes from Twitter but it doesn't really matter because he has firmly accepted what I'm about to read anyway.","Jake Brancatella"
"7544320","7557140"," The Muslim who errors in secondary matters of Aqidah example does Allah literally have a hand is far better than the individual with the perfect Aqidah who allies with the Kuffar against Muslims and works to abolish the Sharia.","Jake Brancatella"
"7557640","7577940"," Now obviously I don't accept you know and I don't believe in the latter part of it that it's a good thing to ally with the Kuffar against Muslims or abolish the Sharia but nevertheless the thing that I'm pointing out is that he believes that Allah actually having a Sifah of Yed is not something that is important.","Jake Brancatella"
"7578140","7580240"," It's a secondary matter of Aqidah.","Jake Brancatella"
"7581240","7593660"," Another quote he says but they did not talk about them or engage in broader discussions about secondary matters of theology example what is the precise meaning of Allah's hand or his rising over the throne.","Jake Brancatella"
"7593760","7600140"," So he thinks the meaning of Yedullah and Istiwa are secondary matters of Aqidah.","Jake Brancatella"
"7601760","7610760"," Again he says the Salaf did not encourage the common people to study and speak upon secondary points of Aqidah like the uncreatedness of the Quran.","Jake Brancatella"
"7610980","7612360"," He's repeated that several times.","Jake Brancatella"
"7612460","7618140"," He believes that the uncreatedness or createdness of the Quran is a secondary matter of Aqidah.","Jake Brancatella"
"7619060","7623320"," Then he says does the majority of the Ummah affirm that the Quran is uncreated?","Jake Brancatella"
"7623500","7624440"," Yeah I think they do Dan.","Jake Brancatella"
"7624900","7629160"," And then he says common people do not think about these secondary Aqidah matters.","Jake Brancatella"
"7629280","7638100"," So this is just establishing his deviant views that all of these different positions which are fundamental matters of Aqidah he sees them to be secondary.","Jake Brancatella"
"7638380","7642180"," So how could he really be a true Athari or Hanbali?","Jake Brancatella"
"7642700","7650620"," Now let's see what Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal says on the Quran and Dan considers himself to be a Hanbali which is very strange.","Jake Brancatella"
"7651100","7660100"," He says whoever says it referring to the Quran is created then he is a kafir and whoever does not takfir him he is a kafir.","Jake Brancatella"
"7660400","7668960"," So according to Imam Ahmad Daniel Hakikachu is a kafir because he considers the createdness of the Quran to be a secondary matter of Aqidah.","Jake Brancatella"
"7668960","7672940"," Which is not a worthy to make takfir over.","Jake Brancatella"
"7673480","7677560"," So according to Imam Ahmad Daniel Hakikachu is a kafir.","Jake Brancatella"

"9974950","9978070"," And he is extremely critical of Ibn Taymiyyah.","Jake Brancatella"
"9978130","9978710"," Wouldn't you agree?","Jake Brancatella"
"9979850","9981050"," I believe so, yeah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"9981150","9982250"," I don't follow him that closely.","Jake Brancatella"
"9982310","9984590"," Okay, he's very harsh against Ibn Taymiyyah.","Jake Brancatella"
"9984630","9995910"," And I'm telling you that Hamza Yusuf came with the same ignorant comment that you're making that, oh, actually, Hamza Yusuf actually said, oh, nominalism came from the Shaitaan.","Jake Brancatella"
"9996050","9996670"," Did you know that?","Jake Brancatella"
"9997510","10002850"," Shaitaan was the first nominalist, and Ibn Taymiyyah was the first human nominalist.","Jake Brancatella"
"10003150","10006370"," And so basically he's saying that Ibn Taymiyyah was a Shaitaan.","Jake Brancatella"
"10006870","10009690"," Saeed Foda came and said, no, Hamza Yusuf.","Jake Brancatella"
"10009790","10019730"," And his student, I can show you, has written an entire article on this several years ago saying, look, basically, I'm paraphrasing, but his point was, look, we don't like Ibn Taymiyyah.","Jake Brancatella"
"10019950","10020570"," We hate him.","Jake Brancatella"
"10020870","10022730"," And he actually tried to go further.","Jake Brancatella"
"10022830","10025830"," He's like, no, no, no, don't give the credit to Ibn Taymiyyah.","Jake Brancatella"
"10026050","10027750"," We were the first nominalists.","Jake Brancatella"
"10028030","10029890"," The Ash'aris were the first nominalists.","Jake Brancatella"
"10030170","10032750"," Their whole school is nominalism, bro.","Jake Brancatella"
"10032910","10034090"," You don't know this.","Jake Brancatella"
"10034550","10040930"," You're trying to put it on Ibn Taymiyyah, like Hamza Yusuf, and make him the Shaitaan and the scapegoat.","Jake Brancatella"
"10040990","10047750"," But in actuality, this is actually a point of agreement amongst us and the Ash'aris.","Jake Brancatella"
"10048150","10054190"," We don't have this philosophical view of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas and Ibn Sina.","Jake Brancatella"
"10054350","10055410"," That's not our view.","Jake Brancatella"
"10055610","10059270"," We don't believe in these real universals outside of the mind.","Jake Brancatella"
"10059510","10063250"," Now, if you want to say, oh, well, the Setaf didn't talk in detail about these things, I agree.","Jake Brancatella"
"10063350","10064090"," That's not the point.","Jake Brancatella"
"10064510","10065430"," That is the point.","Jake Brancatella"
"10065550","10080610"," No, the point is, there was nobody coming along other than the deviants and the kuffar who are actually saying that there are real universals outside the mind that exist in the Platonic realm or that exist in Daniel HaKikachu and Jake.","Jake Brancatella"
"10080850","10081990"," No, they weren't saying this.","Jake Brancatella"
"10082310","10084170"," So stop blaming Ibn Taymiyyah.","Jake Brancatella"
"10084530","10091510"," Actually come to a view where maybe you have more credit to try to go to, which is the eternality of hellfire.","Jake Brancatella"
"10091730","10094170"," I mean, we've already been going for 20 minutes on the same topic.","Jake Brancatella"
"10094510","10101350"," Well, one thing that I think is significant also is the request to Jinn, because I just can't wrap my head around it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10102490","10104210"," Let's go to the other subject.","Jake Brancatella"
"10104890","10108050"," Maybe you can clarify this one point for me and then we can move on.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10109070","10119330"," Because your whole explanation of sacrificing, not sacrificing, but being able to request aid from the Jinn, is that it's like requesting aid from a person.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10119430","10127230"," As long as the Jinn is present and is able, you're not asking the Jinn to do something that is beyond its capabilities, then what's the big deal?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10127610","10131490"," I gave the King Jinn analogy, but there's another problem.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10132310","10153550"," Because what about your whole crew, you and others, accuse me of promoting shirk because merely for citing the view, not adopting it or saying it's the correct view, that slaughtering for other than Allah or slaughtering for Jinn is not known with certainty to be shirk Akbar.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10154770","10160450"," And this is a big gotcha or this was a big deal that you guys have made over and over again.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10160910","10162810"," Did I do that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10162970","10164070"," It raises the question.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10164170","10165270"," Did I make that big deal with you?","Jake Brancatella"
"10165270","10165730"," Yeah, you did.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10165790","10169430"," You signed on a statement that says that Daniel promotes slaughtering for Jinn not being shirk Akbar.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10170130","10171270"," You signed on to that statement.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10171590","10172750"," So this is the question.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10173150","10180650"," If you can request from Jinn as if they're normal people, why can't you offer them offerings like normal people?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10180650","10193830"," I can slaughter a goat for my guests or for meat, you know, for dinner we're gonna have delicious goat briyani or we're gonna have some lamb or a camel, I don't know, a cow I sacrifice and we're gonna have a delicious beef ribeye steak.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10194050","10195250"," I can do that for humans.","Jake Brancatella"
"10195430","10196870"," Why can't I do that for Jinn?","Jake Brancatella"
"10197610","10204010"," Okay, so first you classified and in the context you said this is what Jake said.","Jake Brancatella"
"10204070","10207370"," Let's be clear, we're talking about Ibn Taymiyyah's view, not Jake.","Jake Brancatella"
"10207710","10210590"," In fact, I said I disagree with Ibn Taymiyyah on this.","Jake Brancatella"
"10210950","10214790"," I said that he says that these things are permissible.","Jake Brancatella"
"10214970","10216710"," First of all, let's deal with the requests.","Jake Brancatella"
"10217090","10219250"," That the requests of the Jinn are permissible.","Jake Brancatella"
"10219850","10234070"," I take the, and I think because I'm influenced by the Maliki Madhab, which tends to do this a lot, which is prohibiting something and declaring something haram so that you close off the gateway to something that's haram.","Jake Brancatella"
"10234130","10236730"," So it doesn't even have to be haram in and of itself.","Jake Brancatella"
"10237070","10244990"," That's my view because I think dealing with the Jinn, us as non-prophets, is potentially dangerous.","Jake Brancatella"
"10245450","10247910"," Now Ibn Taymiyyah had the view that you mentioned.","Jake Brancatella"
"10248250","10251810"," I don't accuse him of shirk because I don't believe the view is shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"10252170","10254890"," I think it's either haram or it's permissible.","Jake Brancatella"
"10255250","10265830"," To say that it's shirk, you need to show that the person is making a request which in itself is shirk, that he's asking of something other than Allah, only which Allah can give.","Jake Brancatella"
"10265950","10268070"," That's my view across the board.","Jake Brancatella"
"10268190","10269790"," I've always been consistent in that.","Jake Brancatella"
"10270010","10275950"," When it comes to slaughtering to other than Allah, I will, I'll throw you a bone here Dan, okay?","Jake Brancatella"
"10276010","10277850"," I'll throw you a bone after a long day.","Jake Brancatella"
"10278170","10294630"," I think that the statement in, the comment in the statement, essentially condemning you, and I don't know exactly how it was phrased because I didn't write it, of slaughtering to other than Allah, I think that it's ambiguous.","Jake Brancatella"
"10295070","10301850"," I think it needs to be disambiguated, a phrase that was used a lot in the last live stream.","Jake Brancatella"
"10302130","10325230"," It needs to be clarified what is exactly being meant, and I'm sure you've seen it, or if you haven't, I think that you and the others should read it, but Sam just posted an article regarding this about all of the different contexts in which you could be slaughtering to something other than Allah, or in the name of, and all of these different things, and they have different rulings.","Jake Brancatella"
"10325470","10327790"," I have no problem with that whatsoever.","Jake Brancatella"
"10329490","10331970"," But okay, Lo, the question...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10331970","10332770"," Did you see that article?","Jake Brancatella"
"10334470","10336590"," I'm not sure if I saw that particular one.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10336610","10337430"," Did it just come out today?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10337870","10338130"," No.","Jake Brancatella"
"10338850","10342050"," I can pull it up maybe a couple days ago.","Jake Brancatella"
"10342330","10351790"," But the question about slaughtering for, so is slaughtering for other than Allah, like the jinn, is that shirk, Akbar, or not?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10351930","10352690"," But that's what I'm saying.","Jake Brancatella"
"10352830","10358230"," It depends what you mean by slaughtering for, because it could have many different meanings to it.","Jake Brancatella"
"10358390","10364450"," No, no, so there's generally two meanings, like slaughtering in the name of, okay, or slaughtering for.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10364650","10365710"," You're slaughtering for them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10366210","10372910"," Like slaughtering for means somebody's coming to your house as a guest, let's say, and you slaughter for them.","Jake Brancatella"
"10372950","10384670"," You slaughter an animal because they're coming there, and you're welcoming them as a guest, but you don't, like, say, in the name of Jesus, and kill the, let's say, cow, or something like that.","Jake Brancatella"
"10384830","10386930"," You're slaughtering in the name of Allah.","Jake Brancatella"
"10387270","10396210"," You do the slaughter appropriately, not even in haram way, because I think, I don't know who you were quoting, Anowi, or who you had in mind.","Jake Brancatella"
"10396590","10405350"," There are different Shafi'i scholars who had different opinions on this, but nevertheless, they would say that it, most of them would even say that it's haram.","Jake Brancatella"
"10405510","10408130"," We're not talking about in the haram or shirk-y sense.","Jake Brancatella"
"10408390","10418290"," You're saying that it's an occasion where a guest comes, and you slaughter the animal, you know, to welcome them and to feed them for coming.","Jake Brancatella"
"10418650","10419670"," No, this is not shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"10421070","10425710"," So jinn are coming as your guests, and you're slaughtering for them, slaughtering a cow.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10425730","10427790"," Dude, what's with the obsession with the jinn, man?","Jake Brancatella"
"10428690","10434790"," I'm being accused for shirk on this issue, so I want to clarify.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10435270","10440230"," So, there are some jinn guests that come, and you slaughter some chickens for them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10440410","10441810"," Not shirk, right?","Jake Brancatella"
"10443190","10450230"," Say that there's some jinn guests, and you slaughter chickens for the jinn coming as a guest, and you feed the jinn, let's say.","Jake Brancatella"
"10450690","10451850"," Yeah, you want to feed the jinn.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10451970","10452890"," You, like, put it on a platter.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10452910","10454910"," I don't believe this is shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"10454910","10455370"," No.","Jake Brancatella"
"10456570","10457370"," Do you believe it's shirk?","Jake Brancatella"
"10458950","10460650"," I think it depends on the intention.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10461350","10463010"," It could possibly be shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10463130","10466910"," It depends on the acts of reverence and ta'zeem that are associated with it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10467390","10469090"," It's probably shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10469630","10470790"," It's probably shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10470950","10472830"," I don't do in-and-of-itself analysis.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10473030","10473610"," Like, that's the difference.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10473690","10474750"," Don't ask me in-and-of- itself.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10475510","10485710"," Yeah, if you're going to be slaughtering chickens and putting it out for the jinn, yes, I do think that is very potentially shirk akbar, and this is not just my view.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10485870","10487310"," Like, you could call me a Wahhabi.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10487390","10490390"," You could call me a Wahhabi because this is what Ibn Abdul Wahhab says.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10490730","10491950"," This is what Ibn Baz says.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10492230","10493470"," This is shirk akbar.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10493690","10495030"," This is what Ibn Taymiyyah says.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10495190","10497910"," This is what Ibn Taymiyyah actually says, and that's the contradiction.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10498190","10503490"," Like, Ibn Taymiyyah, in your analysis, he thinks that you can request from jinn because they're like humans.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10503790","10509450"," Like, they're capable, but when it comes to sacrificing for the jinn, oh no, now it's shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10509750","10509910"," Why?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10510190","10516850"," You can offer meats that you slaughter for your guests, for your human guests, so why can't you do that for human jinn?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10517250","10519210"," And you've basically said that, yeah, there's no problem.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10519950","10521210"," Human jinn, I think you misspoke.","Jake Brancatella"
"10521270","10523290"," Or with jinn guests.","Jake Brancatella"
"10524010","10528870"," Okay, so let me, you're saying that I'm, I don't know, maybe you think that I'm representing my own view.","Jake Brancatella"
"10528990","10529290"," I'm not.","Jake Brancatella"
"10529390","10535510"," This is from the article, and it was published on the 27th, so this is almost a week ago.","Jake Brancatella"
"10536590","10538310"," Ibn Uthaymeen says, what?","Jake Brancatella"
"10539870","10542230"," No, I know, I didn't, I didn't try to put it on the screen.","Jake Brancatella"
"10542350","10543750"," I could put it on the screen if you want.","Jake Brancatella"
"10544290","10546190"," Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna read you the quote.","Jake Brancatella"
"10546810","10547930"," I'm gonna read you the quote.","Jake Brancatella"
"10548050","10550550"," Ibn Uthaymeen says, these are the two different views.","Jake Brancatella"
"10551730","10555570"," Slaughtering for other than Allah is divided into two categories.","Jake Brancatella"
"10556350","10561710"," Slaughtering for other than Allah as an act of devotion to seek closeness and veneration.","Jake Brancatella"
"10562390","10566030"," And this is major shirk that expels one from the religion.","Jake Brancatella"
"10566510","10574930"," And slaughtering for other than Allah out of joy and hospitality, which you just talked about, and this does not expel one from the religion.","Jake Brancatella"
"10575150","10583270"," Rather, it is among customary matters that may sometimes be required and sometimes not required.","Jake Brancatella"
"10583510","10587350"," And the basic ruling concerning it is permissibility.","Jake Brancatella"
"10587350","10605390"," Ibn Uthaymeen also says in a second quote, as for when slaughtering for other than Allah occurs by way of honoring, such as honoring a guest, for example, if a guest comes to you and you slaughter an animal for him in order to present it to him to eat, then there is no problem with that.","Jake Brancatella"
"10605530","10607930"," Rather, this is something that is commanded.","Jake Brancatella"
"10608350","10615130"," So not only is it not haram or shirk, he's saying it's actually wajib to do for your guest.","Jake Brancatella"
"10615410","10622370"," And Dan, since you love the jinn guest so much, I mean, I don't know, maybe you have a lot of them coming over, then yes, there's no problem with doing it.","Jake Brancatella"
"10622490","10628890"," But he said, if it's an act of devotion to seek closeness and veneration, then this is major shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"10629550","10630430"," This is our position.","Jake Brancatella"
"10631410","10633710"," I'm not making up my own view, dude.","Jake Brancatella"
"10633770","10636010"," You're making it seem like I'm making my own view up.","Jake Brancatella"
"10636010","10637330"," It's an inconsistent view, yeah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10637390","10646710"," It's inconsistent and it's like, you know, like the people who are sacrificing or slaughtering for jinn, like they're in the villages, like they're in the villages doing blood sacrifices.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10646710","10647850"," Dan, you're adding to the story now.","Jake Brancatella"
"10647970","10648510"," You're adding to the story.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10648510","10649310"," But look at this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10649530","10655150"," This is the statement that Bassam signed and you signed on this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10655450","10662050"," Daniel has also downplayed other polytheistic practices, such as offering sacrifices to jinn.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10662710","10663190"," Yeah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10663430","10664730"," So how did you know why I meant by that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10664830","10667990"," First of all, I never said that it's okay to offer sacrifices to jinn.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10668430","10673110"," I just said that it is potentially shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10673590","10674690"," It is inconsistent on these factors.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10675010","10676330"," And there was ikhtilaf amongst the scholars.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10676550","10677370"," That's what I said.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10677490","10677610"," Okay.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10677830","10679230"," And I've been consistent on that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10679310","10683030"," And then there's the statement from Wahhabis, including you and Bassam, condemning me.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10683270","10688730"," And it's saying, I'm reading it, he has downplayed other polytheistic practices, such as offering sacrifices to jinn.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10688810","10692870"," And now you're telling me that, yeah, there are certain contexts where that's perfectly fine.","Jake Brancatella"
"10693050","10693230"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"10693270","10694410"," So let's clarify it.","Jake Brancatella"
"10694670","10698330"," Do you agree with what the quote from Ibn Uthaymeen just said?","Jake Brancatella"
"10698710","10703170"," And don't forget, forget about is Ibn Uthaymeen consistent or not in his views?","Jake Brancatella"
"10703510","10708530"," I'm saying the view that he just mentioned, do you agree in substance with that?","Jake Brancatella"
"10709750","10713090"," That if you're slaughtering for other than Allah...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10713090","10713930"," It depends on the intention?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10714390","10715070"," Hold on.","Jake Brancatella"
"10715270","10725250"," If you're slaughtering for other than Allah, right, as an act of devotion to seek closeness and veneration, do you believe that that is a major act of shirk?","Jake Brancatella"
"10726170","10729750"," Yeah, I think it, depending on the nature of the reverence.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10729890","10731670"," Yeah, that's a part of my analysis.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10731830","10733010"," But it's about intention.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10733230","10734130"," It's about beliefs.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10734850","10736370"," You agree with that.","Jake Brancatella"
"10736790","10750610"," And when slaughtering for other than Allah occurs by way of honoring a guest, for example, if a guest comes to you and you slaughter an animal for him in order to present it to him to eat, then that is not necessarily shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"10750770","10751470"," You agree with that?","Jake Brancatella"
"10751670","10759130"," It depends on if it's a human being that I can see, or like some person that I can see, versus an unseen entity.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10759370","10762370"," If he's an unseen entity, if it's a jinn, is it shirk akbar?","Jake Brancatella"
"10763270","10765870"," No, I think it might be shirk asghar.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10766370","10767770"," I think it's haram.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10768050","10773950"," I think it could potentially get to the level of shirk depending on the ta'zeem, depending on the beliefs.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10774570","10775610"," Okay, so then...","Jake Brancatella"
"10775610","10777650"," I'm not down with what you just described.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10778350","10784770"," I don't think that, oh, just because you're sacrificing for the intention of honoring jinn...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10784770","10787670"," You don't agree, but you don't believe that it's necessarily shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"10787910","10788730"," That's my point.","Jake Brancatella"
"10788890","10794270"," You agree in the sense of that aspect, that yeah, you don't agree that it's permissible.","Jake Brancatella"
"10795550","10797170"," Ibn Uthaymeen is saying it's permissible.","Jake Brancatella"
"10797350","10798170"," You don't agree with that.","Jake Brancatella"
"10798290","10798910"," That's what's shocking.","Jake Brancatella"
"10799250","10805270"," Yeah, but what's shocking is that Ibn Uthaymeen and other Wahhabis are saying that this is something that could be permissible.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10805650","10811150"," It could be permissible, or it's something that there's not even a mention of it leading to shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10811270","10814070"," Like, aren't we concerned about things that are leading to shirk?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10814470","10816050"," You don't think that it's going to lead to shirk?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10816050","10833910"," Like I said, that's why I said personally that I disagree with Ibn Uthaymeen's position on the requests, because out of a maliki usul point, that I think that we should cut it off before it gets to that point.","Jake Brancatella"
"10834050","10834690"," Blocking the means.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10834830","10836410"," Yes, so I agree with that.","Jake Brancatella"
"10837390","10842150"," But that doesn't mean that I'm saying that I believe that it's necessarily shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"10842530","10843970"," So we're in agreement there.","Jake Brancatella"
"10844090","10845630"," Now I'm throwing you a bone.","Jake Brancatella"
"10845730","10847230"," I already said it in the beginning.","Jake Brancatella"
"10847770","10862690"," If there is a case that you actually do believe that it's not shirk akbar, slaughtering to other than Allah, in an example where we do, then it would still be valid.","Jake Brancatella"
"10862870","10867610"," But on this specific point, then yeah, then you're not guilty of shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"10869550","10876930"," Not only are you not guilty of shirk, like you're doing something that's permissible, according to Ibn Uthaymeen.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10877390","10877850"," Yeah, exactly.","Jake Brancatella"
"10879010","10880410"," Blows my mind.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10880650","10884010"," We only have five minutes left, and you've been pretty much questioning me the whole time.","Jake Brancatella"
"10884010","10884430"," Okay, fine.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10885630","10887050"," Is it kufr?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10889570","10893250"," Can someone accuse the Prophet of committing shirk?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10895410","10897930"," Can someone accuse the Prophet of committing shirk?","Jake Brancatella"
"10898050","10898250"," No.","Jake Brancatella"
"10899510","10902030"," But bro, you've been questioning me the entire time.","Jake Brancatella"
"10902110","10903130"," We have five minutes left.","Jake Brancatella"
"10903190","10904470"," Can I ask you a couple questions?","Jake Brancatella"
"10905370","10907610"," No, this is the question.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10907830","10911890"," You're saying that you cannot accuse the Prophet of committing shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10912090","10913310"," That's what Ibn Taymiyyah does.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10913550","10919270"," Can you show me where he said that he believes that, or where he's accusing the Prophet of committing shirk?","Jake Brancatella"
"10919810","10923650"," In the story of the cranes, he affirms that story.","Jake Brancatella"
"10923750","10924710"," Are you not aware of this?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10924970","10941990"," That shaitan came and through the verses, the satanic verses, praising Allat, Uzza, and Manat, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, according to Ibn Taymiyyah, actually recited those praise, the praise of these idols, which would be an act of shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10942390","10958150"," Okay, so Dan, just as you said that we are trying to come up with an explanation for what scholars are saying, and you brought up the position earlier about the companion, that who would actually accuse the companion of shirk?","Jake Brancatella"
"10958530","10965390"," Do you believe that Ibn Taymiyyah is actually saying that he's accusing the Prophet, peace be upon him, of shirk?","Jake Brancatella"
"10965730","10970810"," In other words, how do you think that he's explaining that in his own mind?","Jake Brancatella"
"10971570","10975490"," No, but can we agree that he is accusing the Prophet, peace be upon him, of committing an act of shirk?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10975490","10976370"," No, I don't believe that.","Jake Brancatella"
"10976410","10983690"," That's why I'm asking you, I'm asking you, how do you think Ibn Taymiyyah is justifying whatever you're attributing to him?","Jake Brancatella"
"10985030","10988550"," Okay, if you're not clear on what I'm attributing to him, let me clarify.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10989290","10992890"," Ibn Taymiyyah says, there's this story, okay, that's narrated.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"10993370","11016450"," The vast majority of scholars says that this is inauthentic, it is rejected, and in fact it might be kufr, Qadiyyat and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi indicate, or actually Fakhr al-Din al-Razi explicitly says that it's kufr to affirm this, because it's accusing the Prophet, peace be upon him, of uttering shirk, uttering shirk, and then being immediately corrected, and Jibreel immediately correcting that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11016810","11033150"," Ibn Taymiyyah says that this is an authentic narration, it's authentic, that this happened, the Prophet, peace be upon him, in Surah al-Najm, he did add these satanic verses, so he committed shirk, and Ibn Taymiyyah gives an explanation for that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11033150","11034010"," What is his explanation?","Jake Brancatella"
"11034970","11041350"," I mean, he gives an explanation that it doesn't matter the fact that he's accusing the Prophet, peace be upon him, of uttering shirk.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11041350","11042490"," But what is his explanation?","Jake Brancatella"
"11042670","11043210"," I'm asking you.","Jake Brancatella"
"11043310","11050350"," It's like a very long explanation that's about the Isma of the Prophets, what is the nature of the infallibility of the Prophets.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11050570","11051830"," But you can't summarize it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11052930","11059510"," Yeah, I mean, he's trying to talk about the Isma of what is the nature of Prophets being infallible and not making mistakes.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11059630","11067190"," And he thinks that, he thinks, you're saying that Ibn Taymiyyah believes that a Prophet can fall into major kufr and shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"11068130","11070230"," Well, is uttering praise?","Jake Brancatella"
"11070230","11071370"," No, but is that what he's saying?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11071530","11079790"," You're saying he gives an explanation that has to do with the infallibility, the scope of the infallibility of the Prophets.","Jake Brancatella"
"11080110","11089690"," In that discussion, is he saying that the scope of the infallibility of the Prophets is outside of major kufr and shirk, that they can actually fall into that?","Jake Brancatella"
"11089770","11090750"," Is that what he's explaining?","Jake Brancatella"
"11091070","11092410"," Yeah, I mean, that's the story.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11092410","11093190"," I don't believe that.","Jake Brancatella"
"11093230","11093950"," You have to show that.","Jake Brancatella"
"11094330","11098670"," The story, do you not agree that, do you understand the story of the cranes?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11098730","11110090"," I haven't seen, I haven't read, I'm being honest, I have not read Ibn Taymiyyah's explanation of this in detail on how you're saying he attempts to justify it.","Jake Brancatella"
"11110250","11117910"," So, I'm not going to agree with you out of hand and say, oh yeah, Ibn Taymiyyah is actually accusing the Prophet, peace be upon him, of shirk.","Jake Brancatella"
"11118290","11120270"," And your explanation doesn't even make sense.","Jake Brancatella"
"11120550","11131410"," And the fact that you can't really summarize what he's saying, seems like you either don't know, or you don't really want to tell me, because if you do, it's going to show that in actual fact, he's not really accusing the Prophet of that.","Jake Brancatella"
"11131730","11136850"," So, I guess you just don't know much about Ibn Taymiyyah's views, and that means...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11136850","11139630"," No, I said about this specific issue in detail.","Jake Brancatella"
"11139870","11142170"," You haven't even told me what it is.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11142290","11143450"," Let me finish, okay?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11144030","11150090"," So, it looks like you don't know Ibn Taymiyyah's views in detail, so why are you trying to say that he is an Atheri?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11150370","11155170"," Why are you defending him as an Orthodox Atheri, when you don't even know the details?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11155550","11157630"," That's what you said about me and the Esharis, right?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11158010","11159610"," So, it looks like you don't actually know.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11159650","11160530"," You don't know what they are.","Jake Brancatella"
"11160630","11165370"," I spent 35 minutes schooling you on what Ibn Taymiyyah actually believes.","Jake Brancatella"
"11165750","11169870"," Now, you brought up one example that I have not studied in detail.","Jake Brancatella"
"11170330","11172390"," I asked you to explain it, and you either...","Jake Brancatella"
"11172390","11173150"," I did explain it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11173170","11173750"," No, you didn't.","Jake Brancatella"
"11173790","11174310"," Yes, I did.","Jake Brancatella"
"11174310","11176270"," I said, how does he justify it?","Jake Brancatella"
"11177350","11178330"," I'll explain it again.","Jake Brancatella"
"11178550","11179550"," How does he justify it?","Jake Brancatella"
"11179550","11180170"," Why does that matter?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11180870","11182070"," Look at the scenario.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11182430","11183210"," Why does it matter?","Jake Brancatella"
"11183510","11185970"," Because you said I have to go to the scholars and see how they justify it.","Jake Brancatella"
"11185970","11190250"," When I asked you, how does Fakhr al-Din al-Razi justify his statement?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11190490","11191030"," What statement?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11191310","11192350"," The qanun kulli.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11192510","11193950"," How does he justify that?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11194310","11195530"," Yeah, I can explain it in detail.","Jake Brancatella"
"11196710","11198010"," No, you didn't explain it in detail.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11198010","11198810"," I can explain it in detail, yeah.","Jake Brancatella"
"11198810","11202050"," All of these individuals that I pointed to, you're just giving a snippet.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11202090","11204890"," What is the actual basis for their position?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11205170","11209950"," You can't steal manna very easily.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11210430","11210810"," Yes, I did.","Jake Brancatella"
"11210830","11212250"," I can steal manna very easily.","Jake Brancatella"
"11212330","11217010"," But now with Ibn Taymiyyah, you need me to give you reasoning for it?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11217430","11218710"," I can steal manna very easily.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11219430","11222630"," Look, the explanation is very clear.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11223390","11232090"," There is this story, the narration is that the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was reciting Surat al-Najm of the Qur'an, and Satan came...","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11232090","11233110"," I know this story.","Jake Brancatella"
"11233250","11235870"," I know what the story and narration is.","Jake Brancatella"
"11236230","11242390"," I don't know what you're claiming, which is Ibn Taymiyyah's so-called detailed defense of it.","Jake Brancatella"
"11242750","11248750"," You said it's extremely detailed, and it has to do with the infallibility of the Prophets.","Jake Brancatella"
"11248910","11249890"," I'll summarize it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11250250","11257470"," The explanation that he gives is that the infallibility of the Prophets, it doesn't mean at every single moment.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11257730","11265650"," There is not a mistake in conveying revelation that a Prophet can make that isn't immediately corrected.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11266210","11268010"," So they can't persist in error.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11268150","11275210"," So when the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam recites these verses, Jibreel immediately comes and corrects it, and the correct revelation is given.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11275830","11276610"," That is Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11276810","11283970"," So Ibn Taymiyyah is saying that the fact that this story is authentic, it doesn't actually contradict the Isma of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11284310","11285710"," That is Ibn Taymiyyah's point.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11285830","11287770"," That's his explanation in a nutshell.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11288110","11290390"," And there's more details, but you wanted a quick explanation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11290550","11290890"," That's it.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11293960","11294660"," It's okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"11294740","11295320"," Just continue.","Jake Brancatella"
"11295720","11296220"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"11296300","11297360"," So you want to continue.","Jake Brancatella"
"11297500","11300100"," So am I going to be allowed to ask you a question?","Jake Brancatella"
"11300380","11302800"," You've been grilling me for over 40 minutes.","Jake Brancatella"
"11303200","11308020"," I haven't been able to ask you a single question, and you spent your entire presentation.","Jake Brancatella"
"11308020","11315560"," It's supposed to be an either-or about Daniel Hakiketu versus Ibn Taymiyyah, and you presented absolutely nothing about your own views.","Jake Brancatella"
"11315600","11323740"," You spent the entire time critiquing Ibn Taymiyyah, and you haven't spent any time attempting to defend your own view as an athiri.","Jake Brancatella"
"11324080","11328960"," So I'm going to ask you, what is the meaning of the knowledge of Allah according to Daniel Hakiketu?","Jake Brancatella"
"11331640","11332960"," Have mercy on me.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11333980","11335960"," We've been at this for how many hours?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11336120","11338560"," You're asking me to define the knowledge of Allah?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11338740","11338960"," Yeah.","Host"
"11339200","11343000"," Do you believe it has a meaning that is known by us?","Jake Brancatella"
"11344040","11346720"," Does it have a meaning that is known by us?","Jake Brancatella"
"11348780","11349180"," Yeah.","Jake Brancatella"
"11349280","11350420"," And the knowledge of Allah, yeah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11350880","11351280"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"11351440","11353140"," It has a meaning that is known by us.","Jake Brancatella"
"11353440","11355700"," Does Yadullah have a meaning that is known by us?","Jake Brancatella"
"11358540","11359320"," I don't know.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11359500","11360280"," I really don't know.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11360640","11361300"," So you don't know.","Jake Brancatella"
"11361460","11363240"," So Yadullah, you're not sure.","Jake Brancatella"
"11363260","11364360"," I take the position of silence.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11365000","11365800"," I plead the fifth.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11365820","11366400"," But what does that mean?","Jake Brancatella"
"11366500","11367720"," I've heard you say that before.","Jake Brancatella"
"11367900","11368460"," What does that mean?","Jake Brancatella"
"11368660","11374300"," I take the position of Ibn Hanbal, Imam Ahmed, who said that we did not get into these issues.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11374780","11376760"," We did not delve into the secondary matters.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11376900","11380860"," And in fact, Ibn Taymiyyah says, I never introduced these matters to the public.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11381120","11382800"," I never did that deliberately.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11382840","11385720"," I never introduced these issues of sifat to the public.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11385820","11386880"," That's Ibn Taymiyyah's position.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11387080","11388100"," I take the same position.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11388200","11391000"," I want to introduce these kinds of debates to the public.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11391180","11391360"," I'm not asking.","Jake Brancatella"
"11391480","11393280"," I'm just asking your position.","Jake Brancatella"
"11393520","11394800"," I didn't ask you to go in detail.","Jake Brancatella"
"11395300","11398620"," Do you take the position that we don't know the meaning of Yadullah?","Jake Brancatella"
"11399500","11402280"," This was not discussed by the Salaf, okay?","Jake Brancatella"
"11402420","11404100"," I'm a true Salafi here.","Jake Brancatella"
"11404420","11409480"," I'm the true Salafi because I don't get into issues that were not discussed by the Salaf.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11409480","11413840"," So you refuse to say if you affirm a meaning for Yadullah or not?","Jake Brancatella"
"11414920","11421940"," This is the kind of statement that someone came to Imam Malik and tried to grill him on what does istawa mean.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11422140","11425500"," And Imam Malik said that, I see that you're trying to do something evil.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11425680","11425880"," No.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11426000","11427280"," He said we know the meaning.","Jake Brancatella"
"11427500","11428520"," He said the meaning is known.","Jake Brancatella"
"11428600","11429620"," We don't know the kafiyah.","Jake Brancatella"
"11429840","11430000"," Yeah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11430080","11434160"," I affirm everything that is in the Kitab and in the Sunnah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11434360","11435240"," I affirm everything.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11435260","11436440"," What is the meaning of Yadullah?","Jake Brancatella"
"11436660","11437460"," I affirm everything.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11437740","11440640"," And this kind of interrogation, I maintain silence.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11440640","11442720"," You could say that you don't hold a view.","Jake Brancatella"
"11442980","11443640"," You could say.","Jake Brancatella"
"11443720","11444880"," I maintain silence.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11445040","11446400"," I plead the fifth, okay?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11446480","11452900"," And this is what all lay Muslims should do in the face of Wahhabi harassment and interrogation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11452940","11453040"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"11453080","11453440"," Yeah.","Jake Brancatella"
"11453540","11457460"," So Daniel, you do not affirm a position on the meaning of Yadullah.","Jake Brancatella"
"11457640","11458340"," That's what you're saying.","Jake Brancatella"
"11458700","11470460"," And then the last question for you is what do you make of the quotes from Ibn Qadamah that I read where he accuses the Ash'aris of believing that the Quran is created and calls them Zanadika?","Jake Brancatella"
"11472760","11473480"," Cool story, bro.","Jake Brancatella"
"11474500","11475440"," So that's it.","Jake Brancatella"
"11475500","11475860"," That's it.","Jake Brancatella"
"11475900","11476600"," The cool story.","Jake Brancatella"
"11476860","11479300"," So do you think Ibn Qadamah was a real Athani?","Jake Brancatella"
"11480040","11480760"," Yeah, I do.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11481080","11486020"," So he can hold that view and you can disagree with him and you're both real.","Jake Brancatella"
"11486080","11487720"," Yeah, I can disagree with a lot of people.","Jake Brancatella"
"11487960","11493440"," That's my whole theme of the discussion for eight freaking hours that, yeah, we can disagree.","Jake Brancatella"
"11493720","11494720"," We can disagree with them.","Jake Brancatella"
"11494720","11500960"," So you don't believe that if somebody believes the Quran is created, that that is a Kufr view.","Jake Brancatella"
"11501120","11502000"," You don't believe that's Kufr?","Jake Brancatella"
"11502080","11502700"," Yeah, it is.","Jake Brancatella"
"11502880","11507380"," I take Ibn Taymiyyah's position though that it can be like he didn't do Takfir of them.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11508960","11510440"," Although there could be an excuse.","Jake Brancatella"
"11510800","11513480"," So it's Kufr, but you don't necessarily make Takfir on it.","Jake Brancatella"
"11514220","11515100"," Yeah, I mean, whatever.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11515340","11515540"," Okay.","Jake Brancatella"
"11515620","11522060"," So that means the mainstream Ash'ari and Maturidi views of the Quran being created are actually Kufr.","Jake Brancatella"
"11522340","11522920"," So thank you.","Jake Brancatella"
"11523000","11524640"," You've just considered the previous debate.","Jake Brancatella"
"11524980","11525280"," Thank you, sir.","Host"
"11525520","11525620"," Checkmate.","Host"
"11525960","11527320"," All right.","Host"
"11527320","11527740"," All right.","Host"
"11528160","11532280"," Inshallah, you can move on to your closing statements.","Host"
"11532640","11534280"," Was it, it was Daniel?","Host"
"11534280","11535020"," I spoke first.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11535200","11535740"," Good.","Host"
"11538000","11538600"," Okay.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11538600","11544600"," Yeah, my closing statement is that there's a lot of shocking views that we see from Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11545000","11559880"," And I love Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his intellect, his piety, his spirituality, this, his zuhud, like there's so much to admire about Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11559880","11567800"," And I can acknowledge him as Shaykh al-Islam while also acknowledging that he had some views that reached the level of Kufr.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11567960","11569300"," I mean, that's the reality.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11569500","11581000"," If you are going to deny that Allah has created the universe from nothing, if you're going to deny that hell is eternal, like clear Nasr of the Quran, you're going to deny that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11581180","11593220"," If you're going to accuse the Prophet of speaking shirk or committing shirk akbar, like praising idols, or that requesting from jinn is perfectly halal, perfectly fine.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11593260","11595620"," If you have those kinds of views, that's very problematic.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11596260","11598120"," They're very problematic views.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11598500","11607880"," I can acknowledge that my methodology and my approach of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah, which is Ibn Taymiyyah's approach himself, because Ibn Taymiyyah, like this is one of the beautiful things about Ibn Taymiyyah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11608160","11612460"," He acknowledges the possibility that he himself could be wrong on issues.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11612580","11622900"," He has that level of humbleness, and he has the level of intelligence and confidence to say that, look, this is what I think, but I could be wrong and my opponents could be right.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11623160","11626760"," And he means it not in a lip service type of way.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11626820","11628080"," He genuinely means that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11628260","11629880"," And that shows his intellectual maturity.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11630140","11631400"," And I strive to be like that.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11631620","11639140"," I strive to think, well, this is what I think makes sense to me, but I can see how a reasonable person would disagree and take a different position.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11639400","11641000"," And I would like to talk to that person.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11641240","11644360"," I would like to have a discussion with that person and try to learn their perspective.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11644540","11646260"," And maybe my position will change.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11646460","11650020"," In my own life, my positions on many things have changed drastically.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11650360","11651140"," I was Shia.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11651340","11652000"," I was Shia.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11652220","11653440"," I became Sunni.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11653500","11667260"," That is one example of many others, but that requires a kind of humility and sincerity that I hope that I can imbibe as taking Ibn Taymiyyah, Shaykh al-Islam, as my example.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11668080","11687280"," And overall, again, I wish that the same kind of husn al-dhan that you have for Ibn Taymiyyah and a willingness to go to bat for him to find any explanation, any way to justify these kinds of perspectives, I wish that's the perspective that I have for all the ulema, the respected ulema from the salaf and the khalaf.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11687380","11688040"," That's my approach.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11688340","11692360"," But you just limit it to one scholar or to one group of scholars.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11692520","11694660"," And I feel that that is inconsistent.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11695560","11701400"," I would say also that, again, reiterate that I pray to Allah for sincerity.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11702060","11706880"," I pray to Allah that we can reconcile, that we don't need to have this kind of beef.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11706980","11708120"," We don't need to have this.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11708380","11718220"," And I hope that inshallah, just like you have different views and you've evolved, just like I have, that you also evolve out of some of these more hardcore sectarian perspectives.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11718480","11728500"," I really hope that because I really, really appreciate the work that you've done, Jake, against Christians, against even atheists.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11728820","11730800"," And this is what people have said.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11730860","11733420"," This is something that you should continue in and focus in.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11733620","11735800"," And what you're defending is not necessary.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11736160","11737740"," This is not something that's necessary.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11737840","11739700"," It's not saving anyone's iman.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11739920","11741380"," It's only causing more doubts.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11741540","11742500"," It's causing more shubuhat.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11742600","11749620"," It's actually being the cause of people, may Allah save us, that people could potentially enter the fire because of these kinds of discussions.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11750120","11757860"," So please, let's just understand that we can be ahlus sunnah wal jamaah with respect, with respect for the ulema.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11758080","11759660"," We don't have to takfir each other.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11759780","11769760"," We don't have to make these dumb, embarrassing condemnation letters that then you have to walk back from and you have to kind of soft disavow.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11769820","11771300"," Like, oh, I don't agree with all of the wording.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11771560","11772620"," Okay, then why did you sign it?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11772760","11773900"," Like, why did Bassam sign it?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11773960","11778900"," And then he comes out later with an article, oh, actually, Uthaymeen says that you can slaughter for the jinn.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11779020","11780180"," Like, this is embarrassing.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11780460","11784240"," This is a humiliation and you're actually harming Muslims.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11784400","11785180"," Forget about me.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11785240","11786040"," Who cares about me?","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11786220","11792800"," But others are being harmed by this kind of debate and Wahhabi attack on people.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11792980","11793620"," Look at what's happened.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11793620","11795360"," Look at the fallout from the tier list.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11795580","11800240"," Look at where things have led you and your compatriots.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11800380","11800980"," It's sad.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11801340","11811700"," There are people like Farid, people like Adnan, they're targeting me as the worst enemy of Islam, bigger than David Wood and Apus and all of this filth.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11811900","11820360"," This is shocking levels of hatred for a Muslim brother that you then go to takfir and pray for breaking his back and breaking his neck.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11820680","11821800"," It's shocking for me.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11821940","11823060"," It's shocking for the Muslim community.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11823340","11824640"," I really pray for reconciliation.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11825040","11829320"," I pray that we can get past this Wahhabi fitna and get to better times, bi-idhnillah.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11830100","11832640"," So, jazakallah khairah for the debate.","Daniel Haqiqatjou"
"11835110","11837910"," Now to you, Jake, for your five-minute conclusion.","Host"
"11839710","11840550"," Okay, bismillah.","Jake Brancatella"
"11841550","11848090"," Yeah, so I think in this particular debate, Daniel spent a lot of time attacking Ibn Taymiyyah's views.","Jake Brancatella"
"11848630","11866450"," It was clear he didn't really even understand Ibn Taymiyyah's views, accusing him of being the creator of nominalism and spearheading it and all these kind of things, saying that he believed in the eternal universe, which he didn't, which I had to explain to him, explaining about the issue regarding eternal hellfire.","Jake Brancatella"
"11866990","11873690"," All of these points that were brought up about the asking from the jinn and these kind of things, I answered all of them.","Jake Brancatella"
"11873770","11874570"," I explained all of them.","Jake Brancatella"
"11874930","11884970"," But Dan didn't really do much defense of himself being a real atheist, other than just claiming it and attacking Ibn Taymiyyah, which I thought was really interesting.","Jake Brancatella"
"11885610","11895250"," But, I mean, since you're summarizing kind of on the whole evening, I think that people can go back and see who was more consistent, who was not, on the positions that they attempted to defend.","Jake Brancatella"
"11895910","11920350"," Dan made some shocking statements about, you know, taking the communion, not necessarily being shirk akbar, about Andrew Tate and Omar Suleiman not necessarily committing acts of kufr and shirk akbar, praying to the dead and asking them to give you children and rizq and all of these things is not necessarily shirk akbar.","Jake Brancatella"
"11920710","11923050"," So we still have a lot of points that we differ on.","Jake Brancatella"
"11923610","11935650"," He thinks that, you know, people can have fundamentally kufri views in terms of their usul and yet still be a part of Ahl al-Sunnah and not be having, you know, deviant creeds.","Jake Brancatella"
"11935770","11947910"," I mean, how could you say that the Ash'aris and Maturidis don't have deviant creeds when in their fundamentals you agree that their fundamental positions are, some of them anyway, are actually deviant or even kufr?","Jake Brancatella"
"11948090","11949670"," I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.","Jake Brancatella"
"11949770","11953130"," It honestly defies any reason whatsoever.","Jake Brancatella"
"11953910","11957750"," And you're making this statement about reconciliation.","Jake Brancatella"
"11958590","11965730"," There can be no reconciliation with people in the sense of, you know, genuine holding hands together.","Jake Brancatella"
"11966330","11976730"," There can be no reconciliation of that sort with people who are defending kufri and shirk views and, you know, spouting them all around on the internet.","Jake Brancatella"
"11977370","11997350"," And in addition to that, accusing certain people like me of being government agents, being part of unit, what was it, 8200 with the Mossad and all this kind of garbage or being a part of so-called Abraham Accord countries and sending electronic flies and all this nonsense.","Jake Brancatella"
"11997730","12007370"," People don't know, but, you know, some of this stuff has gotten me pressed by governments and I don't actually get paid by any foreign government.","Jake Brancatella"
"12007690","12009030"," I have no help whatsoever.","Jake Brancatella"
"12009490","12026210"," In fact, my PowerPoint that I have which maybe I'll make publicly available has over 150 PowerPoint slides that I spent time putting together in the hotel room and prior to that on the plane and all different things with not very much notice by myself.","Jake Brancatella"
"12026350","12034290"," I don't have people helping me, sending me this information and, you know, money behind me from these foreign governments and everything like that.","Jake Brancatella"
"12034290","12048310"," So I don't really think there can be a reconciliation until there are apologies issued from you regarding some of this slander and the lies against people like me and Fareed and Adnan.","Jake Brancatella"
"12049130","12052990"," And, you know, that would at least make it somewhat cordial.","Jake Brancatella"
"12053150","12054110"," But in terms of the","Jake Brancatella"
"12054110","12060110"," theological differences, they're fundamental and we can't just sweep them under the rug and,","Jake Brancatella"
"12060110","12063590"," you know, act like, you know, we're going to have a good time against the kafir because","Jake Brancatella"
"12063590","12069350"," if an actual fact, if you're honest about this and you know that this is true, how this all started","Jake Brancatella"
"12069350","12076210"," was we were supposed to team up in a debate against two Christians on Fresh and Fit, which I","Jake Brancatella"
"12076210","12083510"," think Myron's guy here has been doing actually a great job behind the scenes actually recording","Jake Brancatella"
"12083510","12084810"," unless I'm wrong about that.","Jake Brancatella"
"12085050","12086670"," I think that he's associated with that.","Jake Brancatella"
"12086810","12089630"," So that's how it all started.","Jake Brancatella"
"12089630","12093670"," And I said, look, Dan, I want to defend the ethnicity position.","Jake Brancatella"
"12093750","12099070"," You were like, no, I don't want to defend any specific sect or group's position.","Jake Brancatella"
"12099330","12102370"," And therefore, you know, long story short, we fell out.","Jake Brancatella"
"12102410","12109650"," And I said, well, I'm not going to go into the debate defending like a general kind of Sunni view that allows for Ash'ari and Maturidi views.","Jake Brancatella"
"12109710","12110810"," I'm not defending that.","Jake Brancatella"
"12110850","12113930"," I want to defend specifically my theological school.","Jake Brancatella"
"12114250","12115670"," You didn't think that that should be done.","Jake Brancatella"
"12115950","12118970"," I thought that that was a big mistake and actually played out in the debate.","Jake Brancatella"
"12119110","12120970"," So this is how it happened.","Jake Brancatella"
"12121070","12128110"," It didn't happen through some personal beef or jealousy or anything like that.","Jake Brancatella"
"12128110","12133430"," It happened out of a debate that we were supposed to team up to, which quite frankly, I was shocked.","Jake Brancatella"
"12133530","12136810"," I was like, wait, I thought Daniel was an ethnicity.","Jake Brancatella"
"12136930","12139470"," He doesn't want to defend these views.","Jake Brancatella"
"12139650","12140310"," What's up with that?","Jake Brancatella"
"12140390","12141490"," That's weird.","Jake Brancatella"
"12141770","12144710"," And then everything just kind of spiraled out of there.","Jake Brancatella"
"12144790","12150730"," I think a lot of the views that you have been espousing, I think you've had a genuine development over time.","Jake Brancatella"
"12151130","12156750"," And I think it's due to your political views that have influenced you for better or worse.","Jake Brancatella"
"12156830","12159770"," And I think for a lot for the worse.","Jake Brancatella"
"12160410","12168070"," But anyway, thanks to the moderator here and also Sean for behind the scenes, helping with the camera.","Jake Brancatella"
"12169330","12174570"," You know, I think it's been a long day, but at the very least, I hope the audience was able to benefit from it.","Jake Brancatella"
"12174630","12178190"," And if I made any mistakes, it's from myself or the Shaytan.","Jake Brancatella"
"12178750","12181790"," And yeah, thanks to the audience for sticking with us.","Jake Brancatella"
"12182750","12183230"," Awesome.","Host"
"12183350","12184830"," Jazakumullah khair to both of you.","Host"
