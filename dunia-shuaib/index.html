<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/duniashuaib" target="_blank">Dunia Shuaib</a> presents herself as a pious Islamic speaker and scholar with over 1 million followers worldwide. She travels to mosques and organizations teaching about Allah, marriage, and Islamic values. But behind the religious facade lies a disturbing pattern of deception, false accusations, and alleged criminal behavior that has devastated lives.</p>

<p>Her ex-husband (Salman) supported her career for years—building her website, editing her videos, creating her course materials, and managing her bookings. They were together for 4 years before marrying in 2019. After just 2 years of marriage, she filed for divorce in 2021. What followed was a nightmare of lies, slander, and what her ex-husband (Salman) describes as attempted murder through "swatting."</p>

<h2>TEN Shocking Behaviors of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/duniashuaib" target="_blank">Dunia Shuaib</a> Including EVIDENCES!</h2>

<h3><span style="font-size: 64px; color: #ff0000;">1.</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/duniashuaib" target="_blank" style="color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none;">Dunia Shuaib</a> Falsely Accuses Her Ex-Husband of Adultery (Zina) Under Oath</h3>

<p>The most heinous accusation: Dunia falsely accused her ex-husband (Salman) of adultery (zina) in court documents under oath. She even told her friend Nahila Morales that her ex-husband (Salman) was "caught cheating and committing zina on camera" while working at her brother's car audio shop.</p>

<div class="evidence">
<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES:</strong> There is no such video. Her ex-husband (Salman) challenges her publicly to release this alleged footage. Islamic scholars know that falsely accusing someone of zina carries severe punishment in Surah An-Nur, yet this supposed "religious teacher" made this accusation without any proof whatsoever.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Pattern of False Accusations:</strong> In 2015, Dunia told her ex-husband (Salman) that her then-husband Muhammad was "physically and emotionally abusive"—casting herself as a victim to gain his sympathy. Years later, her ex-husband (Salman) realized this was the exact same script she used against him. The same false accusations, the same victim narrative, the same pattern of lies.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 64px; color: #ff0000;">2.</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/duniashuaib" target="_blank" style="color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none;">Dunia Shuaib</a> Submits Fake Nikah Contract with Imam Omar Suleiman's Name to Court</h3>

<p>Dunia submitted a <strong>completely fake nikah (Islamic marriage) contract</strong> to the court, listing <strong>Imam Omar Suleiman</strong> as the officiant and backdating their marriage to January 15, 2016—just 12 days after her divorce from her previous husband, during her iddah period!</p>

<div class="evidence">
<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES:</strong> Their actual nikah was performed by Mufti Hussain Kamani in May 2019. Her ex-husband (Salman) has video evidence of them applying for their marriage license where Dunia clearly states "we're not married yet." This is document forgery submitted under oath in court.</p>

<p>For years, Dunia presented herself as a "certified therapist," "psychologist," and "marriage and family therapist" who counsels couples. She told different scholars different stories about her credentials.</p>

<div class="evidence">
<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Audio recordings of her telling Shaykh Dawood Butt: "I'm a certified therapist"</li>
<li>Videos of her saying she performs "marriage and family therapy"</li>
<li>But then in a Ramadan 2022 livestream, she admits: <strong>"I do not perform any type of counseling. I am not a licensed therapist."</strong></li>

<p>This woman has been deceiving the ummah, counseling vulnerable Muslims about their marriages while having no legitimate credentials!</p>

<p>For 5 years (2016-2020), anyone booking Dunia or corresponding about events dealt with "Sister Noor Sharif"—her assistant who managed emails, bookings, and social media.</p>

<div class="evidence">
<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES:</strong> Noor Sharif never existed. It was Dunia the entire time, creating a fictional person to manage her communications. She even created Facebook posts as "Noor" and responded to them as herself. Search any organization's emails from that period—they'll find correspondence with this imaginary person. This level of deception is pathological.</p>

<p>Dunia submitted altered audio recordings to court making her ex-husband (Salman) sound violent and abusive.</p>

<div class="evidence">
<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES:</strong> her ex-husband (Salman) has the original, unaltered recordings. His lawyer Brian confirmed the submitted version was "clearly altered." her ex-husband (Salman) even emailed Dunia's lawyer Lisa Canterbury exposing the doctored evidence, with Dunia CC'd for transparency. When confronted, Dunia blamed her own lawyer for the fabrication.</p>

<p>In a disturbing pattern, Dunia accused her ex-sister-in-law Baha of trying to <strong>run her over with a car THREE separate times</strong>—at RIC mosque, at MASS, and at Roots/Qalam campus. She claimed to have two witnesses each time.</p>

<div class="evidence">
<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Audio recording of her phone call describing these "attempts"</li>
<li>She claimed one witness (Dimple or Sana) spoke to Mufti Kamani about it</li>
<li><strong>Yet she never filed a single police report for any of these alleged attempted murders</strong></li>
<li>When pressed, she couldn't keep her story straight about which event and which mosque</li>

</div>

<p>her ex-husband (Salman) challenges: <strong>Mufti Hussain Kamani should speak up—did any sister approach him about attempted murder? The alleged witnesses (Fatuma, Karwana, Najah, Sana, Dimple) should come forward.</strong></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 64px; color: #ff0000;">7.</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/duniashuaib" target="_blank" style="color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none;">Dunia Shuaib</a>'s Alleged Connection to Swatting Attack That Nearly Killed Her Ex-Husband</h3>

<p>After her ex-husband (Salman) published a website exposing Dunia's lies, a coordinated retaliation occurred that can only be described as attempted murder:</p>

<p><strong>Friday Morning, 6 AM:</strong> An anonymous call to Irving Police claimed her ex-husband (Salman) had stabbed his girlfriend to death and was about to kill himself with a gun.</p>

<div class="evidence">
<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>911 call audio recording</strong> (included in transcript): Caller impersonating her ex-husband (Salman) saying "I stabbed my girlfriend several times. She's not breathing anymore. I have a gun. I will end my life."</li>
<li>Police body cam footage of SWAT-style raid breaking down his door</li>
<li>her ex-husband (Salman) woke up to guns pointed at him; officers later told him they were "ready to shoot"</li>
<li>He grabbed a baseball bat thinking intruders broke in, but something made him put it down—likely saving his life</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p><strong>Immediately Following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of spam emails and texts</li>
<li><strong>36 BILLION cyberattack hits</strong> on his web server in 36 hours from 138 countries (primarily Russia and China)</li>
<li>Police called to his elderly mother's home 1,000+ miles away</li>
<li>Police, fire trucks, ambulances sent to his sister's home, terrorizing her young children</li>
<li>4 credit cards opened fraudulently in his name</li>
<li>Threatening texts: "Will send SWAT team to break down door and traumatize your children"</li>
<li>Call to his children's Islamic school spoofing his number, claiming "her ex-husband (Salman) will be shot tonight"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Second Swatting Attempt:</strong> Two weeks later, another false call claiming her ex-husband (Salman) planted explosives around his house about to detonate—another attempt to get him killed by police.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 64px; color: #ff0000;">8.</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/duniashuaib" target="_blank" style="color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none;">Dunia Shuaib</a> Files False Police Reports with Fabricated Claims About Her Ex-Husband</h3>

<p><strong>The Event:</strong> NTIC (North Texas Islamic Council) hosted a town hall meeting on domestic violence. Dunia was one of the panelists. After all panels finished presenting, during the closing announcements, her ex-husband (Salman) calmly raised his hand from the back of the audience. He briefly mentioned hoping organizations would screen their panelists, as he had been falsely accused of zina by one of them. He then left the building and spoke with speaker Muhammad Ayachi in the hallway for 10-15 minutes before going home.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened Next:</strong> Nearly 2 hours later, at 5:45 PM, Dunia called Richardson Police with completely fabricated claims.</p>

<div class="evidence">
<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES—911 Call Audio Recording:</strong></p>
<p>Dunia told Richardson Police the following lies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her ex-husband (Salman) was "screaming and yelling and putting up a storm" <strong>DURING her speech</strong></li>
<li>He "stood up and interrupted" her presentation</li>
<li>Security had to "escort him out" of the building</li>
<li>She's "afraid to go outside" because "he sometimes follows me to my events"</li>
<li>He once "pulled up a chair and sat and made a scene" at a dinner she was at</li>
<li>She claimed she had a "protective order" against him that expired</li>
<li>She claimed he "routinely shows up at her venues causing disturbances"</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><strong>The Reality (verified by witnesses, video footage, and police records):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>✅ He spoke calmly AFTER all presentations ended, during closing announcements—never during her speech</li>
<li>✅ He remained seated in the back row the entire time</li>
<li>✅ He was NEVER escorted out—he left normally when the event ended around 4:00 PM</li>
<li>✅ He spent 10-15 minutes talking peacefully with speaker Muhammad Ayachi in the hallway</li>
<li>✅ Multiple shuyukh (Islamic scholars) walked past them during this conversation—no one intervened because there was no issue</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Police investigation found: "Officer checked... no criminal history or expired protective order"</strong></li>
<li>✅ The police report documents her claim: "She advised she would contact her brother as said man is afraid of him"—this never happened</li>
<li>✅ He had never shown up at any of her other events or caused any disturbances</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Pattern:</strong> This was not an isolated incident. Dunia has a documented history of filing false police reports to paint her ex-husband as dangerous, violent, and mentally unstable—all while he has never been charged with any crime, has no restraining orders, and has witnesses who can verify the truth.</p>

<li>Mentally unstable with "psychological issues"</li>
<li>Physically, emotionally, and financially abusive</li>
<li>A stalker who follows her to events</li>
<li>Violent and dangerous</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nahila Morales Confession:</strong> In a recorded meeting with multiple Embrace co-founders present, Nahila admitted Dunia told her her ex-husband (Salman):</p>
<ul>
<li>Worked at her brother's car audio shop and was "caught cheating and committing zina on camera"</li>
<li>Was physically abusive</li>
<li>Committed adultery</li>
</ul>

<p>Nahila relayed this to Brother Walter who was vetting her ex-husband (Salman) for marriage to another sister, nearly sabotaging that marriage. When confronted, Nahila showed zero remorse, claiming she was "just a messenger with good intentions."</p>

<p><strong>Islamic Center of Irving:</strong> Dunia told them:</p>
<ul>
<li>They'd been divorced 4 years (actually 2 years)</li>
<li>Marriage lasted less than a year (actually 2 years)</li>
<li>her ex-husband (Salman) has "mental issues"</li>
<li>He wanted to remarry her and "went crazy" when she refused</li>
<li>She has a "legal restraining order" (doesn't exist)</li>
</ul>

<p>They cancelled her event when she couldn't provide the restraining order and when Sheikh Waleed Basuni vouched <strong>against</strong> her.</p>

<p><strong>Valley Ranch Islamic Center:</strong> After the swatting attack, an emergency security meeting was held. her ex-husband (Salman)'s photo was circulated to 30+ people in group chats, warning he was a "possible threat to the masjid with mental issues" and "domestic abuse incident." No one from the masjid ever contacted her ex-husband (Salman) to verify. Brothers stared at him during khutbah. A friend was warned to "be cautious" around him.</p>

<p><strong>Mental Health Evaluation:</strong> After Dunia's claims, Irving Police sent a mental health response team to evaluate her ex-husband (Salman). <strong>Result: No evidence of any mental issues whatsoever.</strong></p>

<p>Dunia demanded a $20,000 mahr—calling anything less "embarrassing to her father." After the divorce she initiated, her ex-husband (Salman) forgave the entire $20,000 plus an additional $5,000 she owed him.</p>

<p>Yet she tried to paint him as "financially abusive" in court, claiming she paid rent to her parents and car payments on a "gifted" car.</p>

<div class="evidence">
<p><strong>THE EVIDENCES:</strong> Dunia's ex-husband (Salman) has testified that he took her on Umrah to Mecca and Medina, to Palestine, Spain, France, Switzerland, Colorado (3x), California (2x), Seattle (3x), Cancun (2x), Vancouver, New York, Florida, Chicago. He bought her: 3 MacBooks, multiple iPad Pros, 3 top-line iPhones, 4 Apple Watches, studio equipment, and even a $600 hair dryer just 4 days after marriage.</p>
